    • Nevaeh (“Nivea”) Moonstar and Odo Falcanspur are both nobles, who grew up as friends. Nevaeh’s mother Nova was an adventuring companion of Odo’s dad Othar. She’s heading towards a small town where she’s been directed to go in search of her old friend Odo. She’s passed through Loudwater, where she recognized Marshall Blackheath, a retainer of the Falcanspur family who’d been delivering a letter to Fort Gilbert, who confirmed that Odo was at Fort Gilbert.
        ◦ she’s learned where Odo is from his family, who gave her some letters to deliver when she reaches town
        ◦ Nevaeh has literal golden hair, pointy ears, and her leaps carry her farther than they should (like as far as a harengon’s leaps). Her shield has her goddess’ symbol on it (a stylized female eye surrounded by 7 stars), since she’s a cleric of Selune (goddess of the moon & of motherhood)
    • Xanthos stole a smokey glass sphere from Terzio, but thinks he won’t miss it. He says its a record-keeping device. Kaz takes it curiously, hears a psychic message as though it were a translated television voiceover “Fungal growth outside exceeding tolerable levels, need to send a team to cut it back”
        ◦ Kaz can hear that the original language is similar to Elvish in some respects
        ◦ Zuggtboy keeps the sphere
    • The infected trogolodyte corpses are still where we left them, even though Szordrin’s body isn’t there. The Xorn heads back to Terzio, we head back to the surface
    • Everyone is very excited to see Xanthos alive and well. Gilbert says that despite his differences with the party, he’s grateful that they saved Xanthos
    • Nevaeh arrives to Fort Gilbert and is allowed past the gates once Odo vouches for her. She bounds up to Odo and picks him up in a hug. Odo introduces Nevaeh to the rest of the party, and she exuberantly shakes their hands with both of hers
    • We head to Amy Applehill’s Alehouse. There’s a whole celebration going on for Xanthos’ return, and the people cheer for us when we walk in.
    • We sit down with Nevaeh and catch up. She reveals that she’s trying to get to the celestial realm, and has come to ask Odo for help getting there.
        ◦ Kaz shares a few ways to reach the celestial realm. One can get anywhere from Sigil, or by travelling through the Astral Plane, or by specific gateway/portal (very rare)
    • Toby & Mavis (pregnant lady and her husband who got captured by drow) stop by to say hi to everyone. Nevaeh gives the mother and child her blessing
    • We head back to Odo’s place and crash for the night. In the middle of the night, Lyesgiel wakes up gasping but not from a nightmare, says that he needs to do something alone but doesn’t know when he’ll be back, won’t tell us what it is he has to do, and leaves
    • we wake up, go to breakfast, and pray with Nevaeh. 
    • We pass little Toby as we’re walking toward the mine entrance to meet up with Terzio,  Toby looks up and points “Mommy, look! A dragon!” Emony Applehill looks up and screams. There’s an enormous dragon flying down to the town. It would dwarf Terzio easily. All of us except Zuggtboy are struck with sudden terror
    • Lady Rhydell looks oddly calm, clutching at a necklace. The dragon suddenly flies back upward, it’s wingbeats buffeting us, sending us crashing to the ground and blowing the thatching off rooves
        ◦ Lady Rhydell’s pendant is a profile of a dragon head, symbol of Bahamut
        ◦ 
    • Sir Gondrian recognizes the dragon as Old Ashmaker, who lives like 70 miles away, so while people are always afraid he’ll show up, no one really expected it. Lady Rhydell shares that his real name is Rhezorodroth, and that he’s an ancient red dragon
    • We hear a horn outside the gates and a voice yelling “Open the gates for the heralds of Rezorodroth, king of fire!” The guards open the gates for six kobolds, followed by the three heralds: a dragonborn, a hobgoblin, and a tiefling
    • The lead kobold warns that if any of them are harmed, the town will be immediately razed to the ground. We agree to the parlay and head to the inn for privacy.
    • Unsarek, chief herald (dragonborn); Lorrgesh (hobgoblin); Screech (horns). “We’re here to discuss your theft. We’ve been informed by a friendly wizard that this town has been extracting riches that belong to Rezzorodroth. By what right do you come here from afar and steal from Rezzorodroth?”
        ◦ They claim that a wizard has told them that we had 100,000 gp worth of valuables. We question the wizard’s honesty, but they don’t seem to care
    • Sir Gondrian begs for forgiveness, saying that they didn’t know they were on Rezzorodroth’s land and that they’re willing to leave the town and its valuables to Rezzorodroth
    • Odo and Kaz point out that very little of value has been found. We have many bad rolls and aren’t very convincing. The heralds say that we have “one tenday” to fork over what we’ve “stolen” or the town will be razed to the ground. They look at each of the party in turn and say that we’ll be held personally responsible for paying up.
        ◦ one tenday is the equivalent of a week in Faerun. Each month has three tendays.
    • “Gilbert. This was a failure. We’re leaving, not risking the lives of these people that you don’t give two shits about” Gilbert is very intimidated, practically runs away.
    • Lady Rhydell assumes that if the party can get out past Loudmouth, Rezzorodroth won’t bother following them. The plan is to pile all the valuables in the center of town and flee.
    • Gilbert has been insistent the whole time that everyone stay and fight the dragon, and ends up yelling at Sir Gondrian to stay because he’d paid him. Kaz casts Detect Thoughts and probes deep into Gilbert’s mind as she asks “Gilbert! What could possibly motivate you to risk everyone’s lives?” She finds out that in addition to the dig being his life’s work, Gilbert wants to be fucking RICH, and sees the wealth of the Netherese as just out of his reach
        ◦ he’s very pissed that Kaz dug into his mind, and even more pissed that no one is listening to him. He fires the guards, looking very done
        ◦ Kaz yells at him for risking other people’s lives for greed. The rest of the town looks pretty pissed as well, and Gilbert seems intimidated
    • Xanthos gives Kaz a book on the Netherese language: “An introduction to the ancient Netherese tongue and Loross including a grammar and lexicon”
        ◦ Loross was the high language of the privileged upper classes in Netheril
    • in the three excavated floors, Xanthos said they found and sold two spell gems, a few spell scrolls, a magic dagger, and a few other sundry goods
    • We head back down to keep our deal to Terzio, since we don’t want two dragons chasing us/the townsfolk. We head through the large sealed double doors. Just inside is a large archway set against the wall that apparently leads nowhere, which Terzio explains to Kaz was probably a portal to another part of the facility
    • We go further down until we reach the collapsed section. The darrow guiding us pull a vent off the wall, revealing a narrow stone shaft with a ladder leading to the other sections we need to find treasure in. We climb up the ladder to a 10ft wide stone shaft that seems to be part of some sort of ventilation system, then start walking down it. Kaz hears what sounds like gibberish coming toward us. We get ready for a fight, only to see a “textured puddle” that comes around the corner up ahead and seems to be making the noise.
    • The textured puddle finally gets close enough that our brains can process it as “unfathomably ugly.” It rears up and attacks!
    • We fight back, blasting it relentlessly. Zuggtboy casts a wave of spores that cleaves it down the middle, and suddenly we’re fighting two smaller aberrations
    • We finish the fight and continue moving forward through the tunnel, then back down another ladder until we come to another metal grate. We see a 20ft wide tunnel leading off to the left and right, collapsed at both ends but with a gap in the wall on the left. On the wall across from the grate, there’s a heavily damaged mosaic of specific Netherese cities floating above an idyllic landscape.
        ◦ this seems to be the other side of the collapsed hallway that the darrow led us to
    • Odo pops the grate off with his crowbar and we drop down into the hallway. Zuggtboy moves ahead to check out the hole in the wall, finds a very large open room covered in unrecognizable debris
        ◦ fragments of wall coverings, leftover metal fixtures, bits of old furniture, and extremely ancient wood that’s decayed over 3000 years. Also bits of yellowed human bones
        ◦ metal strips are embedded in grooves on the floor in some sort of arcane pattern. We clear the floor to see it. Kaz copies down the design, but can’t identify it
    • Kaz sees a giant eye above sharp teeth peering at the party through one of the two actual doors in the room, before whatever it is pulls away from the door and we hear footsteps running away down the hall
    • Nevaeh sees Mistril’s symbol on the wall near the door, we know that the Netherese worshipped Mistril
        ◦ Kharsus (Netherese leader) was intent on developing a very powerful spell to make himself as powerful as a god and take magic from Mistril. He cast the spell, Mistril was killed, and magic temporarily ceased to function, destroying the empire and killing Kharsus. The whole event was called Kharsus’ Folly
            ▪ The new magic goddess, Mistra, putl limits on the power of spells that mortals could cast because of this shit
    • Zuggtboy opens the door to follow the eye-thing and immediately sees the unexpected. Across the hallway is a giant rectangular floor-to-ceiling window with a faint shimmer instead of glass. Through it, we see a brightly lit park with a pond, trees, benches, and paths. Down the hall are two other windows showing the same park, the other door from the room we were just in, and a third door to a room we haven’t seen
    • We enter the room we haven’t seen. Walling off the back right corner of the room is a cubical shimmer, filled with nothing but more debris apparently. Across the room is a caved-in door, and to our left is another door. We can hear something coming from the room to our left, which sounded like talking in a language we can’t understand.
    • A creature walks through the door and speaks into our minds “You are trespassing. Surrender at once.”
    • Four more creatures walk in robotically behind the first, swords drawn. We surrender, drop our weapons, and lie on the ground as instructed. The four with swords raise them over their heads as if they’re gonna give us a coup de grace. Kaz starts blasting, and the fight is on.
        ◦ as we cut into these creatures, we don’t see any blood. We gather that they’re not living creatures
    • Nevaeh gets to her feet, her eyes glow gold, and enormous golden wings sprout from her back
    • Seeing that these are constructs, Kaz casts Shatter for the first time, since she figures inorganic creatures would have trouble resisting the spell. For a split second, its as if reality cracks between the main creature and two of the sword-wielders. The crack immediately heals over, but the resulting sound wave BOOMS through the room, utterly shattering the three constructs nearby. The pieces disintegrate into green flame
    • The battle finishes, and we rest for a moment
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/19/2022
Nevaeh flies down and shakes off her wings. "That was really cool Kaz"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/19/2022
She grins Thanks. Your wings are amazin'
Is it some sort of spell?
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/19/2022
Thank you!
Mmmm no, I've always been able to do it.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/19/2022
Really? How? I've never seen anyone able to do that! She grins excitedly
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/19/2022
You know how sometimes people say "Your blue eyes are pretty" and then you say "Thanks, my mother gave them to me."
well, my dad gave them to me
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/19/2022
Kaz nods
    • We see the same eye-creature peek around the door at us. On its arm is a metal bracer with filigree
    • Kaz recognizes that it’s clearly something corrupted by aberrant forces, which reminds her of something she’s read about in her studies. She believes its a transformation that happens to wizardly spellcasters of some power that are corrupted and turned into something called a Gnothic. Generally, little-to-nothing of the original caster’s mind is left
        ◦ not a transformation associated with a generally “good” disposition, the Gnothic probably won’t be our friend
    • Nevaeh casts Leomund’s Tiny Hut, which gives us a safe place to rest that appears as an opaque sphere from the outside. Odo takes first watch, sees the Gnothic appear, summon three sword creatures, and disappear. The sword creatures poke at the bubble for a bit, then eventually give up and leave. A bit later, another creature floats forward and examines the bubble, but then eventually leaves. The night passes otherwise without incident
