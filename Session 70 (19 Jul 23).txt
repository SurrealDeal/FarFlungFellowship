    • We decide to spend the rest of the week chilling out at Brin’s Haven and waiting for scouts to return with news. We get to see how Brin’s Haven functions like a small town, with a little school and performances and other events. We watch Erudir, Marcella (who owns the tavern) and Leehan perform together one night to uproarious applause.
        ◦ Lana does an 8hr Plant Growth on the Sporatorium, then buys a 1,000gp agate and uses it to Awaken a small Zirkwood into “Bruce” the following day
            ▪ turns out there’s a type of tree irl named Bruce – a Scottish willow wood
        ◦ Odo does research on the Bear Lord in the Brin’s Haven library. He learns that every type of animal has an animal lord in the Beastlands, but that many typically move around within their layers. The best way to find any given animal lord would be to ask around in the Beastlands.
            ▪ Odo is interested in introducing himself to the Bear Lord, getting to know him, and sharing some of the party’s challenges. Lana suggests that we make the case that Odo has latent werebear blood and ask the Bear Lord to consider expediting his transformation.
        ◦ Nev casts Divine Intervention and succeeds in entreating Selune for aid in locating the Bear Lord. Selune gives her directions to the Bear Lord, who’s located in a giant celestial bear cave in the Beastlands.
            ▪ She also learns that the Ghaele eladrin would be happy to see her again if they met again.
        ◦ Kaz casts Contact Other Plane several times to get to know Exilicor better. She manages to pull it off for five straight days.
            ▪ Does the Far Realm have layers?: total confusion
            ▪ Do you have music where you are?: Kaz feels the familiar sensation of Exilicor rifling through her mind to understand what she’s asking. She hears a bit of music her father played to her, and is asked “What is it?” She smiles.
              “Would you like to hear some music from my world?”
              “Yes” they say.
              Kaz sings a common Elvish folk song. It’s no tavern performance, but the song itself is simple enough that it sounds good. She feels Exilicor listening and gathering information as she sings. “What purpose?” they ask when she finishes.
              “For fun,” she replies. “To feel happy, to dance.” She senses total confusion, so she lets them look through her memories to understand better.
            ▪ Do you have friends?: Exilicor searches Kaz’s mind for that concept too. She sees images pop up of her friends from Torthyr and from Silverymoon, and of the Far Flung Fellowship. They ask for an explanation, and she says “Friends are people who have your back. They care about you, and you care about them too.” She hears the idiom broken down and translated into simpler words as they try to understand. Finally, they say “No.”
              Kaz is a little disenheartened to hear that. “Do you want to be my friend?” she asks hopefully. 
              “Yes” Exilicor says, and Kaz is delighted.
            ▪ Do you know who Selune or Psilofyr are?: Lana and Nev passed this question along. It merits another mind search, calling up images of things Kaz has seen that relate to either deity. She gets a fairly clear “No,” which she later explains to Lana and Nev likely means Exilicor doesn’t know them personally or know of them.
            ▪ Throughout the 5 days, Exilicor starts asking Kaz questions about herself and her world. 
                • “Where are you?”: Kaz tries to project a map of the planes, zooming in on where she is, but is met once more with mystified confusion. “Where is all of that?” they ask. 
                  It takes her a moment to think of a response. “Not where you are” she finally says, accompanied by a memory of the Far Realm rift. “You are there, and I am here”. For the first time, she feels a sense of understanding from Exilicor
    • Nev also casts Commune over several days to narrow down where in the multiverse Vorra is located, and learns that he’s in Arborea, in the layer of Arvandor. She also learns that he’s with some people (but not the eladrin). She Planeshifts to Arvandor to scry Vorra, and learns that he’s walking through a forest holding a spear and accompanied by a motley crew of 6-7 equally big & muscular dudes of various races. He seems uninjured. Lana scries him as well and sees trees she can travel to via plants.
    • The two return to Brin’s Haven to tell Kaz and Odo what they’ve found and the whole party returns to Arvandor the next day to nab Vorra. Lana transports the party to Vorra’s last known location and locates his tracks, then turns the party into various animals so we can move faster.
    • We follow the trail for quite a while, as it winds around in a big arc until we’re travelling backward. Eventually, we come to a cleared campsite, which we pass through into a denser part of the forest. We reach the group of hunters and transform back into humanoids.
        ◦ Hunting Party: two humans, one dark elf, one regular elf, a dwarf, and a casta (planar lizardman). Led by Vorra. They’re all friends of his. Odo introduces himself to them
    • We call out to Vorra, who asks us to identify ourselves. We reintroduce ourselves and explain that we need him to return to Sigil to tend to Lady Renalia’s estate with the other executors. He refuses, since he believes that Lady Renalia’s soul is in Arvandor (as one would expect for a good-aligned elf) and he wants to find her and bring her back. He doesn’t understand us when we say that she’s probably trapped somewhere other than Arvandor, and refuses to leave without her. He also refuses to hear out our arguments that he needs to go back to Sigil and oversee her estate. We leave him to his search and let Linessia know where he is. She sighs and says “That’s about what we thought”
        ◦ He briefly thinks that we’ve been hired by a resurrected Lady Renalia, and is crestfallen when we say that we were hired before her death.
        ◦ He seems to be slightly mad with grief, to genuinely believe that his wife is in Arvandor, and to believe on some level that if he stops looking for her then she’ll truly be gone.
    • Back in Brin’s Haven, the various WV scouts return throughout the week and give their reports.
        ◦ We learn that there’s activity in the Blood War again, but the battles seem staged and halfhearted, nothing more than small, arranged skirmishes that would only fool someone who was unskeptical about the whole situation.
        ◦ The fiends in the Underdark are spreading away from the Chasm of Utmo, demolishing everything in the Lower Dark as they go. These demons, when they’re killed, appear to respawn in the Underdark, though no one is entirely certain that that’s the case.
        ◦ After the way the peace conference ended, various organizations blamed each other for how everything went down. There’s even more friction between the good-aligned organizations now
        ◦ The Cult of the Unholy Child is going around in the Lower Planar cities preaching about how the Unholy Child has come. There’s a superstitious and growing following who are aware of the last prophecy of Hecorius and believe in it despite not really knowing what’s going on or who the Unholy Child is.
        ◦ There are still higher levels of wars, natural disasters, etc going on in the Prime Material worlds, which seem to be fully drawing the attention of the good-aligned groups and the angels
        ◦ The group that went to Myrtion to check on the Alethineum come back with a sketch of where it is and what it looks like. It’s in the Temple of Clarity near the City of Imperia. It’s part of a route that pilgrims take around the surrouding area where they make offerings and pay homage at various shrines and holy places. There’s something called the Test of Clarity – a ritual which involves a trance state. Pilgrims in full fighting gear occasionally come to the temple to take the Test of Clarity, but it wasn’t entirely clear why or what the ritual is. The people who pass the Test of Clarity are able to enter the Vault of Remembrance, where the scouts are guessing the Alethineum is kept.
    • Lana suggests doing some more research into the Test of Clarity before we go. Kaz knows there might be a library in the Realm of Ogma, the Faerunian god of knowledge (who “Uncle Jasper” is a follower of), in the Outlands. We Planeshift directly there and enter the library. We learn that the Test of Clarity is a battle with one’s inner demons, and for warriors it tends to manifest as physical combat. There’s an entire guide to saintly figures and places of worship for Imperia. There’s almost no reference to the Alethineum in the library, save for a minor mention that it’s a relic left behind by a minor deity named Alethinos that vanished due to a fight where he was gravely injured by another evil deific entity (a tenar’ri of the Abyss) that invaded Mount Celestia long ago.
        ◦ Kaz leaves an offering at the temple. She copies down information about the Conduit, now that it’s destroyed and the information is safe to share. She excludes information about Exilicor
    • That evening, Smutlana prepares the party a Hero’s Feast so that we can prepare for the Test of Clarity the following day. We enjoy a sumptuous vegan meal, with shiitake veggie burgers, mushcakes galore, kombucha, and Fellowship Lager (made with Lana & Odo’s yeast). We rest for the night, then proceed to the Seven Mountain Heavens of Celestia on the 27th of Uktar. The Watchful Voyagers offer us white robes so that we can pass as pilgrims (Kaz turns her cloak white instead).
    • Kaz gets a tuning fork for Mt Celestia from Ganth, then we planeshift directly to the Temple of Clarity. We’re in a spectactular mountain vista, with alpine forests and clear calm mountain lakes all around. We appear on a yellowish path, sloping up to a collection of buildings tucked into a gorge. A huge waterfall falls into the gorge, with bridges across the gorge. Around us are fellow penitents, and also floating wisps of blue flame heading up the hill in twos and threes with us. 
        ◦ Kaz knows that the blue flames are lantern arcon, the first level of petitioner in Mt Celestia. They can be promoted to higher levels of arcon. They all strive to climb the mountain.
    • We reach the temple, which has a big open doorway with a tiled floor, an atrium, and a few pilgrims prayerfully looking up at the carvings and frescoes in the entrance chamber. We go deeper into the complex until a man with wings for arms comes up to us. “Welcome, pilgrims. What do you seek here? I am Paradrian, the sword arcon.”
    • Kaz says we seek the Alethineum. Paradrian looks shocked, and assumes that we’re just here to bask in its glory. Kaz explains that we need it to cure Nevaeh’s dad, and he apologizes and explains that no one is allowed to use the relic.
    • Nev takes over and says that in that case, she could use a little clarity about her dad and where he is. Paradrian listens attentively, and suggests several meditation techniques to her. Kaz explains that she’d like to bask in the Alethineum’s power, and Paradrian explains that the power suffuses the entire temple.
    • Kaz telepathically pokes at Odo to ask to take the Test of Clarity. Paradrian looks surprised that Odo knows of the test, and warns him that the ordeal isn’t for the faint of heart. Some people come away quite troubled by the test, though it’s nothing that a short “five to ten year stay” at the temple couldn’t cure. He admits that being away for that many years is often concerning for mortals. Odo says he’s concerned for his friends and family, who don’t deserve to be confronted by the forces that be. If there’s anything out there that could prepare him, he’s already been through it, and his heart is not faint.
    • It’s been quite some time since so many mortals wished to take the test. We’re led to a room with closed doors, which two archons open for us. Inside are several rows of benches, with a geometric symbol on the wall. Paradrian lights some incense and explains that we’ll each meditate on our innermost troubles on our own bench, and the test will begin. He closes the door and leaves us to our fate.
    • We feel a trance come over us as we sit and meditate. The incense produces a purplish cloud with slight sparkles in it, which envelops us.
        ◦ This time, we make our initiative checks based on wisdom, not dexterity. With the hero’s feast, we get advantage
    • We each find ourselves standing alone in a space, enveloped by purple smoke. Nevaeh sees a figure emerge from the smoke. It’s Lord Querial, who says “Well hello, Nevaeh. Do you still want to dance?”
      “Oh are you here for another dance?” she asks.
      He grins. “In a manner of speaking.” Querial produces a mace and attacks Nevaeh.
    • Smutlana thinks briefly of Ranjat, but her mind then turns to “the face of undeath” and the consequences of looking for power in the wrong places. She thinks back to Necropoieties and how it was in control instead of her. And as she thinks that, she sees the staff emerge from the smoke and hears its whispering voice speak in her mind. “You should have trusted ME!”
      Lana pops her spores from her new staff “I don’t need you anymore Neko. I’ve got myself and my symbiote. And that’s all I need.” She casts Draconic Form, using it to enhance her symbiotic power. The staff responds by trying to drain Lana’s life, but Lana manages to throw it off.
    • Odo’s deepest darkest demon is the fear of inadequacy. The fear of not being enough. The thought of all his friends and family lying on the ground, dead or dying. Of his brother, standing at Asmodeus’ side and causing pain and chaos. His hands form white-knuckled fists as the smoke clears and he sees those bodies, and hears his sister Bobbi calling for help. He moves forward and sees Bobbi in the tentacled clutches of a huge, monstrous froghemoth (Odo is also terrified of frogs and toads)
      Pushing past his fear, Odo grips Marcel’s Fang, goes into a rage, and hacks away at the toad.
    • Kaz thinks of Asger, who’s terrified her from the moment they met and threatens her family, her friends and the multiverse itself. Her mind goes specifically to when he invaded the party’s home and stood on the burning balcony, shouting out to his lackeys “Kill them all! But keep the  warlock. I have plans for her.”
      She finds herself back in the aboleth chamber with Asger looking down from above. As she looks up, she sees a shadow fall over her from a tentacled creature looming behind her. She turns and sees a gargantuan tentacled horror looming above her as Asger laughs and laughs. She casts Cone of Cold at it and backs away, forced to move toward Asger. The thing moves toward her and attacks with its lashing maw.
    • Nev refuses to attack Querial, casts Sanctuary on herself, and starts praying to Selune that there’s still good in Querial. She asks for help on what to do. Her prayers must be answered, because she enters a place of serene calm.
    • Necropoieties says “Don’t you know what I represent? Ha ha ha!” and transforms into a towering chain devil – the epitome of robbing one of one’s freedom.
    • The froghemoth swallows Bobbi, then lashes out with its tentacles at Odo. Odo yells out “hold on Bobbi!” surges into action, and hacks it apart (108 damage). Bobbi slides out of its gut, gasping for breath, and looks at Odo with relief. The purple smoke surges around him and he wakes up back in the meditation room.
    • Kaz casts Fire Shield on herself to hurt the aberration whenever it hits her. It bites her again and gives her a particularly nasty lash with its tentacles.
    • Nev heals herself rather than attacking Querial, who continues to try to attack her. She continues to pray until she realizes that Querial’s attacks are no longer hurting her. The purple smoke closes in around her and she, too, wakes up back in the meditation room.
    • Odo sees that Nev is awake, but that Lana and Kaz are still in trances and wincing at things unseen. He grabs Nev’s shoulders for comfort, trembling slightly as he thinks about what he just saw.
    • The slavering horror tries to grapple Kaz with its tentacle, but misses. Kaz realizes that she can’t possibly fight this thing on her own and decides instead to get up on the balcony away from it. She Dimension Doors right behind Asger, and realizes she’ll have to fight him instead.
    • Smutlana throws off the chain devil’s chains and destroys it. She wakes up to see Kaz looking pale and unwell, with sweat streaming down her face. Odo realizes how serious fighting your inner demons can be and goes to sit beside Kaz to support her.
    • Asger turns toward Kaz, leers at her, and says “I have plans for you.” She swears at him angrily in Common and Elvish, then says “I hope you rot in the Hells where you belong” and casts Mind Warp on him. He screams in agony and collapses, and the shimmering purple smoke rushes in to envelop her (with 16hp).
        ◦ Mind Warp’s charge doesn’t get used up, even though Kaz’s other spell slots do?? And John implied it was for a plot reason!?!
        ◦ Kaz had a much more difficult fight because the thing representing her fear was a much higher CR.
    • Paradrian re-enters the room, proud of us for having passed the test, and tells us we can now enter the vault. We choose to take a short rest before we enter the vault.
