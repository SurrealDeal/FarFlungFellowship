    • It’s the 19th of Uktar (before Kaz succeeds at Contact Other Plane)
    • Odo solemnly asks the party to keep quiet about Owen, hoping that he can still be saved. The party agrees, thinking that it’s also good to avoid spreading Odo’s family drama around.
    • Kaz squeezes into the bag of holding to test whether or not Necropoieties could have heard us. The party watches the bag engulf her until she disappears inside, leaving behind an empty bag. Kaz finds herself in a dark space. There is air inside, but it immediately starts getting stuffy. Odo starts talking about how much he likes stew and how he wants to get a recipe from Kaz. Lana talks about how much she misses the smell of ozone in the morning. Kaz doesn’t overhear any of it from within the bag, and tells the party as much when they pull her out. The party concludes that one of the Watchful Voyager leadership must be the mole. 
    • Nev casts Legend Lore on Odo’s family sword, Marcel’s Fang. It started off as the family sword, and gained power over time from blessings, being steeped in a dragon’s hoard, and from Aurdrick defeating a powerful demon, etc. It most recently gained power when someone gave the sword to Rezzoradrath, but the spell fizzles around the person’s name.
        ◦ We gather that because Legend Lore is a Divination spell, the person must be protected from Divination. We also assume that Asger was the one to hand it over, since he was the one who attacked Falcon’s Roost and took it.
    • Odo goes to find Othar and tell him that the party slayed Rezzoradrath and retrieved Marcel’s Fang. Othar was an expert fighter in his day, and is now instructing some of the Watchful Voyagers in swordplay as he settles in. He’s absolutely flabbergasted that the party slayed Rezzoradrath and even more so to see the sword again (particularly because he doesn’t know how the sword ended up in Rezzoradrath’s sword).
        ◦ Odo also inadvertantly reveals that Lady Theolana is a silver dragon in disguise
        ◦ While this is happening, Nev is in the background goofing around with the trainees.
        ◦ Before they part ways, Othar tells Odo not to tell his mother how much risk he’s facing, and Odo agrees
    • Odo removes his armor and disarms himself, then goes looking for Emmealot to challenge her to a sparring session to settle their grudge. He finds her training with her fellow werebears in one of the training rooms. She’s not pleased to see him, particularly when he still tries to flirt with her, and declares that she never wants to see any of us again. She stalks back to the middle of the room. One of the werebears in the room with her transforms into Meili. She goes over to Emmealot and whispers something in her ear, which calms her down enough to accept the challenge of a rematch.
        ◦ Kaz smacks Odo on the back of the head for flirting inappropriately and tries to make a more polite offer for a rematch, but rolls a nat 1.
    • Emmealot starts the fight by shifting into her bear form. Odo takes two swings at her, then tries unsuccessfully to grapple her. His punches don’t seem to be doing anything either. She tries to shove Odo to the ground, but he manages to hold her off. He manages to grapple her and wrestle her down with a series of crit 20s (rolled with advantage because of rage, but still).
        ◦ Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 4:46 PM
          Kaz is on the edge of the rock
          Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 4:47 PM
          the mushcake falls out of Nev's mouth
          "Is this foreplay?"
          Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 4:48 PM
          Kaz chokes on her own mushcake
          Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 4:48 PM
          "It is foreplay."
    • Emmealot is pissed about being restrained. She attacks Odo twice, but can’t manage to hit him from where she’s trapped. Odo punches her a few more times, but still can’t hurt her. Realizing that werebears are immune to any damage that doesn’t come from a magical or silver weapon, he decides to just wrestle her until he can incapacitate her. Emmealot struggles viciously, but isn’t strong enough to break Odo’s hold before he pins her.
        ◦ Odo rolls EVEN MORE NAT 20s
    • Meili blows a whistle. Odo releases Emmealot, who stands and stares at the ground begrudgingly. Meili claps Odo and Emmealot on the back. “Both of you fought well. Good match.” Emmealot reluctantly shakes Odo’s hand. “You’re pretty strong” she says, before leaving with the other two werebears.
    • Meili watches them go. “That was good for her. But what made you decide to bury the hatchet today?” Odo explains that he wanted to make amends for his past actions, that he comes from a line of werebears, and that he wants to become a werebear one day if he’s deserving. Meili replies “I don’t doubt you’re deserving, Odo Falcanspur. You’ve a warrior’s spirit. But there’s nothing we can do to help you.” Odo explains that she helps the party every day by fighting by our side.
    • Meili says “If you want to become a werebear, one day, you might seek out the Bear Lord. But I’ll tell you in advance, you have to do a vigil for a year at his cave in the Beastlands. He’ll give you the blessing if he deems you worthy at the end of the vigil.”
    • We decide to start thinking about how Asger found us in the Plane of Water. We know that the Gesh spell prevents anyone under it from betraying the Watchful Voyagers, but we’re affiliate members so we’re not sure the order not to betray other WV applies to us. We know that we cannot be scried, the Starglimmer cannot be scried inside, and we’re still alive in Brin’s Haven so no one knows we’re here. BUT we know that Asger recently attacked Marvinia, and we suspect they may be connected.
        ◦ We have NOT told the WV about all the treasure we got from Rezzoradrath’s hoard.
    • The Watchful Voyagers leadership ask to meet with us, since it’s becoming clear that we’re both way more powerful and extremely skilled at fighting than anyone would expect given the stage of our careers, and we’re clearly involved somehow in what’s happening.
        ◦ Leltora, Boswell, Torbold, Ganth are present. NOT Doth
    • Torbold wonders how our enemies found us, and independently brings up the possibility of a mole. Kaz brings up a few false suspects, determined not to trust him until she could find the real mole, and he latches onto the Starglimmer crew as possible suspects. He asks Ganth if its possible to get around Geas, and Ganth confirms that it’d be possible, but difficult. Torbold assumes that the fiends don’t know about Brin’s Haven, since everyone inside is still alive. Ganth confirms that the only way into a demiplane without the proper tuning fork is to reach its location in the Ethereal Plane.
        ◦ Neither Kaz nor Lana can detect any dishonesty from Torbold and Ganth.
    • We all agree that we should move our base of operations outside of Brin’s Haven, since there are so many civilians there who we don’t want to endanger. Torbold suggests setting up a mobile base on the astral skiffs and we agree.
    • Torbold says “Our enemies seem to have multiple plans afoot. One of them dealt with the mythallar and the Conduit, which seems to be stymied for the time being. They also seem to have some connection to the corruption of the celestials.” Kaz goes through all the connections our enemies have to each other: how Darala is the child from the Last Prophecy of Hecorius, how she’s dating Asger, and how she’s using the rod to corrupt celestials.
    • Leltora has found some things about the rod we saw Darala using. The demon lord Graatz is known to have defeated Ademarkus, the lord of madness who ruled over the Abyssal layer Occipitus. Ademarkus had a scepter capable of inducing a very potent form of madness.
    • Kaz asks if the scepter could be used against mortals, thinking that perhaps the mole was driven mad enough to believe we weren’t WV and were a threat, and escaped the Gesh that way. Ganth asks why they haven’t corrupted more mortals, and why only celestials betrayed their missions in the lower planes. 
    • We note that it’s possible Darala is the only one able to use the rod, as the child of the prophecy, and that she’s likely leading the fiends to attack the upper planes. It also fits with why she’d risk going to Sigil, where she’d be much more vulnerable.
    • Leltora was also looking into other artifacts, since Lana asked about anti-fiend weaponry. There’s an artifact called the Alethineum that seems to have opposite effects to the scepter of Ademarkus. It’s reputed to cure any form of madness immediately and permanently, even that caused by gods. It is stored in the Temple of Clarity, near Imperia in Myrtion. Kaz knows that Myrtion is the 5th of the 7 Heavens of Celestia (the platinum heaven).
    • Kaz wonders what the plan with the mythallar could have possibly been. Ganth suspects that because the mythallar can make enormous stable portals, some of the essence of the lower planes could’ve leaked through and stabilized the invading fiends. He also remarks that no other magic is powerful enough to do that, not even the magic of deities, and the mythallar was tapping into a power source greater than the Powers themselves (Kaz starts fiddling with her journal when he says that, staring at it with a bit of blank shock)
    • Kaz suggests our next course of action should be to get the Alethineum and cure some celestials, to get them back on our side. Torbold concurs, since getting the celestial hierarchies and the powers to believe in the celestial corruption has always been an issue. He believes that if we could get both on our side, it would be a turning point.
    • Boswell says that his scouts have reported that the pink building and Asger’s tower have both completely disappeared, and Torbold’s jaw drops. “They’re covering their tracks! They knew that we knew about both those buildings, and they were worried we’d bring someone with authority there.”
    • Ganth circles back to the mole, and points out that it’s odd that if we were sold out by someone on the Starglimmer, why didn’t the demons just attack us on the Starglimmer? Torbold defends and says that maybe they just didn’t want to deal with fighting the whole crew.
        ◦ I think it's Torbold. He was quick to jump on the idea that the Starglimmer had the mole, and Ganth is pointing out that it might NOT be the Starglimmer (which would put him under suspicion).
    • We decide to sneak into Sigil to sell our things and get information about what’s been happening since we left. Kaz goes to Ganth to ask for a tuning fork to Arboria, and he tells her to clear it with Torbold. Kaz tells Torbold that the party wants to speak with Branaris’ eladrin family and get clues as to his whereabouts. Torbold is hesitant until Nev adds that she wants to ask for another vision and he relents. He asks to know when we’ll be back, which is somewhat out-of-character for him since he’s never asked before. Kaz can tell (with a 26 on insight) that he’s more concerned than ever for the safety of all the people in Brin’s Haven, including our families
    • Jandar has been helping out in the horse stables, and on the astral skiffs. Angela is training to infiltrate the Lower Planes. Erudir performs at the Wandering Minstrel tavern, and helps out where he’s needed when other bards are performing. We have dinner 
        ◦ There’s also the Silent Guardian tavern, which doesn’t have live performances.
    • The following day (Uktar 20), we planeshift to the Guilded Hall in Arborea. It’s even more guilded and amazing than the Fest Hall. We link up with Cresta, who is sad that Lady Renalia was killed and confused that she hasn’t been resurrected. We do our best to reassure her, and she takes us to the Ren Theater so that the tech crew can professionally disguise us with costume makeup.
        ◦ We get to choose our disguises. Lana disguise looks like a normal human woman. Nev looks like an old lady. Kaz looks like a young elf girl. Odo looks like an orc.
    • We see that the Efrione Treasury and Transfer office is open for business as usual. Kaz briefly removes her disguise so she can access the party’s account and exchange gold for platinum. One of the workers recognizes her as Lady Renalia’s personal friend, bows to her, brings out refreshments on a silver platter, and is generally very hospitable (which she doesn’t quite know what to do with, but appreciates).
    • We head to the market to sell our treasures and buy new ones. We head to the Favel Brothers to sell our magical items and browse their wares. Nev negotiates a discount, with Kaz helping. Lana and Odo venture around to other shops looking for a spell storing ring and some more bags of holding. The shopping takes most of the day.
    • Kaz reaches out to Linessia using her thrall magic. “Linessia, this is the Far Flung Fellowship. We’re back in Sigil, but we can’t stay long. Is everything alright?” Linessia responds almost immediately. “After a fashion, yes. Most of the staff are fine, but we’re a bit limited in what we can do.” She explains that Lady Renalia’s will specifically makes the assumption that she’ll be immediately brought back from the dead, and makes provisions for her executors to have whatever they needed to pay clerics and arrange for the resurrection. It does NOT make provisions for the case that she can’t be resurrected.
    • Her estate is being run by her council of executors Eloudra, Nillica, and Vorra (her husband). Vorra, upon learning that she was dead, announced that he was going to find her and hasn’t been seen or heard from since. By Sigil law, the executors are limited in what they can do with Lady Renalia’s estate. They can pay for day-to-day stuff, but they can’t approve large purchases.
    • Lana suggests meeting with Nillica to put our heads together and locate Lady Renalia’s soul, so Kaz has Linessia ask if we can meet with her or Eloudra. Linessia comes back after a few minutes to let Kaz know that Nillica is willing to meet with the party.
        ◦ Linessia asks how Kaz managed to contact her for so long with magic. Kaz explains that it’s a new piece of magic she learned recently, and her lie is smoothed by the thrall magic.

Nev is going to send to Asara while we're in Sigil and after we're done shopping
"Asara, I need your help. Can we meet in private at the chapel now?"
John Dungeon Master — 07/10/2023 11:25 AM
“The chapel is closed for repairs. There was a fire. It isn’t as safe here anymore. Can you come to the main house? Be careful.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/10/2023 12:12 PM
(If I'm doing a slow old lady walk how long is it going to take me to get there?)
John Dungeon Master — 07/10/2023 12:13 PM
From the market ward where you’ve been shopping, probably around 1 hour
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/10/2023 12:31 PM
(The main house is Lady Renalia’s, yeah?)
John Dungeon Master — 07/10/2023 12:32 PM
Yes
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/10/2023 1:18 PM
So, Nev will turn to the group and say "I need to talk to Asara, I'll only be gone a few hours. I think it's best if I go alone so we don't draw suspicion. I'm just going to see if I can call in my favor."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/10/2023 1:43 PM
Kaz looks confused. “We’re all goin’ to the main house though, to talk with Nillica. Unless you’re askin’ to speak with Asara alone once we arrive?” 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/10/2023 1:52 PM
(Oh is that a thing we decided?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/10/2023 3:00 PM
(Yeah, Linessia told us that Nillica was free to meet with us)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/10/2023 3:03 PM
(whale then, Nev will meet with Asara outside while you guys head in)
We’re allowed to roll another investigation check to see if we can determine how Asger found out we’d be in the aboleth temple. Kaz and Nev both roll nat 1s, and Smutlana rolls a total of 4. We all blame Odo for taking all the nat20s, and he manages to roll an 11.
John Dungeon Master — 07/11/2023 8:50 PM
Ok Odo (truly the brains of the operation) has the following thoughts on a roll of 11: 1) Asger didn’t know about the mirror at first. Nothing about it in the “notes on shitheads” book. 2) when he ambushed you in your house he did. 3) that was before the meeting at Brin’s Haven. 4) if someone at Brin’s Haven is a mole, it’s funny that Brin’s Haven still exists. 
There’s more that is figure-out-able based on what you already know but that’s what you get with an 11. The rest is for you to contemplate.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/11/2023 8:52 PM

Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/11/2023 8:58 PM
Aww
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/11/2023 9:39 PM
Kaz turns her head over her shoulder to address the whole party. “So where do you think Vorra went off to?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/11/2023 9:43 PM
"That's a good question, actually. Maybe we can find out from Nilica. Not sure what lead he has."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/11/2023 9:46 PM
She snorts. “Probably none. Linessia made it sound like he’d run off on some hair-brained scheme. He doesn’t strike me as particularly bright”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/12/2023 12:32 AM
"I'd just be curious to know. Also, in case we end up having to save him."
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/12/2023 12:26 PM
(When we were saving Lady Renalia that first time and we ran into her room and saw Vorra for the first time...I don't recall his reaction to all that, did he brace for a fight or did he run right for the panic room?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/12/2023 1:02 PM
(She ran and got him from her bedroom, which was on the way to the panic room. AFAIK he went with her without a fight)
John Dungeon Master — 07/12/2023 1:03 PM
You’re forgetting that he threw a bronze statue at Smutlana who was running after her because he thought Smutlana was the attacker
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/12/2023 1:04 PM
Oh he did, that’s right
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/12/2023 1:05 PM
Excellent, I did forget that.
