    • We head over to Lady Renalia’s estate at her summons. She’s seated in her solarium with another drow woman wearing a very simple white dress. They exchange a very meaningful glance and touch arms as we walk in, then the second woman walks out of the room.
    • The party claims that the reason Nev sent such disturbing messages to Cpt. Cloudsilver is that Asger Mordelin burned Falcon’s Roost & Angela’s house, and we were scared that other people we know and love will get hurt because of us. Lady Renalia is sympathetic and offers to help us.
        ◦ Lady Renalia is also surprised that powerful fiends are willing to consort with Asger (a human)
    • Lady Renalia can tell that we’re keeping secrets, and implores us to come clean. The party looks at each other, and decides to explain everything in full (except that we’re working with the Watchful Voyagers, and anything about Exilicor). She’s absolutely floored, and has a hard time believing us even though she trusts that we’re not lying. We have very little hard evidence of our claims though, so that’s fair.
        ◦ we realize through her questions that we’ve never seen Asger working with devils, only demons (though the devil Archduchess Glasya certainly knows about him).
        ◦ All of Lady Renalia’s friends, with whom she works to keep the Blood War going, are celestials. Urefius is one of them. (She’s bargained him back safely from the Harmonium)
    • Lady Renalia recommends that we use intracity portals to enter our neighborhood, rather than be seen walking in, so that we don’t endanger our neighbors. She tells us about a couple that she controls.
    • Before we leave, Kaz asks Lady Renalia if any of the celestials she knows have been acting out-of-character. She says that she hasn’t, and Kaz is relieved to hear it. She also works out that we work for the Watchful Voyagers, and that’s why we’re being so cagey. She reassures us that she’s not siding with either the Vigilant Sentinels or “our friends”, and asks that we put her in contact with “our friends” so that she can get the full story.
        ◦ The schism began when the VS accused the WV of kidnapping Nev’s dad. Since Nev trusts the WV, then Lady Renalia would have to trust them as well. 
        ◦ The WV were always the information-gatherers, and since they split from the VS, intel reports have been rather thin.
    • After we bid Lady Renalia goodbye, Kaz casts Sending to Leehan and arranges a meeting between Lady Renalia, Torbold, and the Far Flung Fellowship in three days’ time.
    • We head out for a relaxing spa evening, then head home. Odo hangs out with Willow. Kaz casts Contact Other Plane
        ◦ Are you a god/power?: maybe (confused what a god is. Kaz feels like she’s repeating the word to herself in her head)
        ◦ Are you from the planes originally?: unclear (totally confused about the planes)
        ◦ Are there any portals between the planes and where you are?: unclear (confusion about the planes, portals, ‘reach’)
        ◦ Kaz asks to be put back in the mythallar to spy. She hears perfect silence, which she assumes is because Asger is probably on his way to Faerun. She also tries to leave the mythallar, but can’t change her position in space.
    • The following morning, Odo goes to put his name on the waitlist for Fel, the dabus tattoo artist. He ideates illusory symbols like other dabus, which then fuse with the client’s skin.
    • Nev casts Legend Lore and learns that the Chasm of Utmo is in the deep Underdark beneath North Faerun. Lies 15mi beneath surface. Desolate place, considered largely bottomless (though it’s actually 3 miles deep), and is considered the lowest inhabitable point in the Underdark. It has been the site of conflicts within the Underdark at times, when wars were fought between the dark civilizations of the North (drow, duergar, etc). It’s also known to be a location in which the Weave (magical fabric of the world, used for casting spells) is particularly weakened. There are sometimes strange effects with magic (weird magical side effects or magical dead zones) in the area surrounding the chasm.
        ◦ She also casts a couple Sending spells. She reassures Cpt Cloudsilver that she’s okay, and learns from Khim that Tammy and the other recruits are on a training mission outside the city
    • We planeshift to the Chasm of Utmo. Chunks of rock have rent apart, leaving behind jagged stone every which way. Several tunnels lead away from us. Tracks from strange creatures criss-cross the settled sediment around us, and we hear something roar in the distance.
    • We walk down one of the tunnels, away from the distant roar, until we come to a cliff face. We can see that the tunnel continues 50ft above us, so Nev flies up and Kaz spiderclimbs up with her slippers. Just before they can toss a rope back down to Lana and Odo, we’re attacked by several gricks crawling from a crevace in the ceiling
    • We fight and kill the gricks and move further down the rocky tunnel. Eventually, our tunnel intersects with a perfectly round tunnel with slightly rough sides – like a pipe. Kaz can’t detect any magic from it. Lana communes with nature and learns that there are no buildings or people within 300ft in either direction down the pipe. The pipe itself doesn’t seem to have been constructed by people. The right side leads slightly up and the left side leads slightly down. We choose to follow the pipe downward.
    • After about 3 mins, the tunnel curves gradually through a 70 degree arc, then returns to a straight path. Another few minutes of walking go by, until Nev sees a thing with a giant mouth and teeth filling the tunnel and surging toward the party. 
    • Nev goes to cast Word of Recall, but realizes that the magic feels weird enough that if she were to cast it, the party’s limbs would probably end up scattered across Toril. The party flees back down the tunnel, casting a few spells back in the gargantuan worm’s direction. Odo stands before the rampaging beast, staring right into its maw as he interposes himself between it and the rest of the Far Flung Fellowship. It swallows him right as Smutlana casts Polymorph, and his body immediately bursts through the newly turned sloth, killing it and turning it back into a giant worm.
    • The worm speeds forward and swallows Nevaeh just as Kaz Banishes it, taking her with it to a harmless demiplane. Kaz is furious and panicked that the others started running toward the worm and got eaten. She runs back with Odo and Lana to stand behind where the worm once was, orders Lana to cast Polymorph again, and releases the worm from Banishment.
    • Lana turns the worm briefly back into a sloth, Nev bursts from its stomach, and is immediately crushed up against the tunnel wall by the restored worm.
    • Odo manages to slay the worm by stabbing it in the butt. Nev manages to wriggle out past its relaxing body. Kaz pulls her the rest of the way behind the worm and gives her a tight hug.

John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 9:47 PM
As you watch the purple worm’s bluish hemolymph gush out of its carcass, anyone who is paying attention to it can make a perception check if they want
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 9:52 PM
(19)
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 9:53 PM
You see something glittering
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 9:53 PM
Kaz reaches out to pick up the glittering item with Mage Hand
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 9:55 PM
It’s a ruby probably worth around 300gp
But, you see another one too
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 9:56 PM
She pulls back in surprise, then cautiously picks up the second ruby as well. "What in the Hells are these doin' here?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 9:57 PM
(heh, I got a 19 too. Nev is laying next to its mouth I think at the moment, on the ground)
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 9:57 PM
(Next to its stinger, you were all at the rear)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 9:58 PM
(okay)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 9:57 PM
(I'm gonna look for more gemstones. With an expression of absolute befuddlement)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 9:57 PM
"Maybe it's leftover from whoever or whatever it last ate."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 9:58 PM
She shudders slightly. "I prefer to think it simply ate it's way through an underground vein"
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 9:58 PM
You see a sapphire flow out of the hole in the carcass
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 9:59 PM
"Oooo, blue." Nev will pick that one up
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 9:59 PM
"Pretty!"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 9:59 PM
(Do they seem magical?)
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 10:00 PM
(You don’t sense any obvious magic)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:00 PM
"Don't think they're gonna blow up in our hands at least."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:03 PM
Kaz watches the hole intently. "I suppose that's one way to get valuables from a creature."
She looks at the hole for a moment longer, thoughtful. "Do you think we should cut it open and try to find more?" she asks, already pulling out a knife.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:04 PM
"I don't want to go anywhere near the inside of that thing again. It's all yours." Nev will stand back off to the side.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:06 PM
She shrugs, pushing her bracers up a few inches and cutting into the worm's side.
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 10:06 PM
Make a str check
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:09 PM
(17)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:10 PM
(ooo that's good for kaz)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:11 PM
(I know!)
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 10:11 PM
You find that its carapace is extremely difficult to cut through. You bear down and grit your teeth and manage to cut through it, but you can tell it’s going to be like butchering an armored whale
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:12 PM
Kaz huffs with the effort. "Odo! Can ye help me cut this thing open?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:12 PM
Nev looks actually shocked.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:12 PM
(I imagine Kaz manages to cut like. 5 inches)
(With a lot of huffing and puffing)
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 10:12 PM
The inside isn’t much softer than the outside
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Yesterday at 12:48 PM
Odo would have assisted
( 19 Athletics Check - 5 Animal Handling Check - 18 Strength Check - 13 Dexterity Check )
( Could Odo with those rolls, start to segment, dissect, dismantle and field dress the worm [then hauling to the side the segmented bits of worm flesh and meat to make traversing the path of the tunnel easier] )
( Also is the worm edible? Like would a 10 on Nature Check be able to tell Odo if the worm can be consumed / what bits are good vs what bits aren’t )
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 1:15 PM
Odo tries to help Kaz cut into the worm but it’s very slow and hard. It seems like its going to take many days to butcher it. It does not look edible and you’re not sure if it’s poisonous.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:13 PM
Do I see any more gemstones while I'm cutting?
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 10:13 PM
No
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:14 PM
She sighs, stepping back from the carcass and cleaning herself off with a wave of her hand. "Well, if any other gemstones fall out, we'll grab them."
She sits down next to Nevaeh. "Are you alright?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:15 PM
"I don't even know how to answer that question."
"How are we going to get out of here?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:17 PM
She sighs again. "Well, if we can't teleport out from here, then let's just walk down the tunnel until we get out of this strange magical zone. Maybe take a short rest first." 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:18 PM
"What if it's not leading us out?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:20 PM
Kaz shrugs. "I can't imagine the damage to the Weave would be that large. And even if it were, I could probably Dimension Door us past this worm's corpse if I had to. We'd just walk back here."
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:27 PM
(Are the gems cut or uncut?)
(Like they're rough or from someone's jewelry or something)
John Dungeon Master — 03/27/2023 10:28 PM
(That’s a great question, they are uncut)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:29 PM
(curious)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:32 PM
She drums her fingers on her knees. "D'you think Lady Renalia will come around? Torbold can be pretty convincin', but she's a shrewd lady"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:35 PM
"I'm hoping we convinced her enough that there's no reason for us to make all of this up. She gave us those three options, ya know. We're telling the truth, we're lying, or we're being lied to. She'd have to assume we're being honest or being lied to, and either way she'd have to act on it. I guess."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:36 PM
"Or we're simply mistaken. But aye. We'll need to convince her somehow" 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:38 PM
"At least her guard is up now, and her resources can pull more info than we can probably."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:39 PM
"Aye. And she's willin' to help us against Asger"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:40 PM
"Which is huge. It's nice having those portals around town too. Certainly don't want to bring any of our work home"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:42 PM
She nods solemnly. "We shouldn't sell anything we stole from Asger there, either. As far as we know, he has no reason to search for us in Sigil. And it's a big city, besides" 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 10:44 PM
"Think he'll keep probing in Waterdeep?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 10:48 PM
"I'm not sure, but I wouldn't be surprised. It's his only lead left." She looks worried.
"That said, the House of the Moon is one of the most well-defended sanctuaries in the world. It would be hard for him to hurt any of the priestesses or worshippers there"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/27/2023 11:16 PM
"Yeah, that's true. I do worry now that Tammy is out on training rotations though..."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/27/2023 11:35 PM
She hums. "Aye. We'd best keep an eye on her, and keep off Asger's radar if we can"
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/27/2023 11:54 PM
Smutlana sees everyone mining gems from the worms butt and shoves everyone aside greedily.
“No one knows their way around a butt like me, or my name isn’t Smutlana Smutwhisper.”
Smutlana turns into a badger and burrows into the butt
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:00 AM
So, you quickly find that the carcass is vastly tougher than the earth through which a badger can burrow, but you are small enough to simply crawl up its digestive tube
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 12:01 AM
Kaz scoots her legs back to let Smutlana past. She watches him crawl into the carcass with a look of 'this may as well happen'.
"Better him than us"
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:01 AM
(Right, not burrowing through flesh)
(Just… crawling up the poop chute)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 9:29 AM
(Imagine if this was how Minecraft worked)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 12:02 AM
"I'm going to throw up."

Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:07 AM
Badgers have burrow speed of 5ft
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Yesterday at 12:56 PM
( now I can't get that song out of my head ... long live Macromedia Flash - all hail the time of the internet where ActionScript ruled supreme )
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 1:02 PM
(God bless Adobe Flash player and all the content people created for us to enjoy)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:12 AM
So roll a perception check
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:12 AM
Obviously stopping before stomach acid
Adv on this one sec
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:13 AM
You’ve got 100s of feet of lower intestines to work with before you get there
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:13 AM
18’s
100’s of feet?? It’s just a straight shot isn’t it? It’s a worm 
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:14 AM
No
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:15 AM
They’re deuterostomes
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:15 AM
So?
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:16 AM
Doesn’t that mean they’re just straight through? It’s not intestines mammals and shit
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:19 AM
These are actually protostomes
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:20 AM
Yeah that
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:21 AM
And no, neither protostomes nor deuterostomes are necessarily “just straight through”, though I have to respect your sophistication in D&D lawyering which has reached the point of arguing over invertebrate body plans
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:21 AM
I was kinda just fishing with that one ngl
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:21 AM
You find a further 2,200gp worth of gem stones
Bringing the total to 2,900
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:22 AM
Eating waffles rn and trying to mine a purple worm’s butt for buttcoin
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:24 AM
So let’s make sure we keep track of who has the gems
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:24 AM
Smutlana will carry the buttcoins
Wow, 2900.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 12:26 AM
(I just kept one blue gem)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:27 AM
Ok that was worth 300gp
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 12:29 AM
Smutlana is birthed out of the worm’s butthole as a badger baby, and drops all the gems into a pile, walks 10 feet away and changes shape
“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again - trash into treasure, I tell you what. Nevaeh and Kaz, a little help with the cleanup if you don’t mind?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 12:31 AM
Nev hurls.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 9:24 AM
(Kaz kept the two rubies)
Kaz swiftly casts prestidigitation on Lana before he can come any closer. You all recall that she’s done similar for Odo when he’s come over for a hug or a pat on the back after some particularly disgusting activity, and her reaction time shows it. 
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 9:26 AM
Each worth 250
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 2:10 PM
(Can we go through the way the cave-in happened?)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 2:11 PM
(If you mean did it open up a new route, no it’s solid there, but you can continue along the pipe in the direction you had been going) 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 2:13 PM
(Okay, yeah that's what I meant. Wasn't sure if the cave-in blocked our path.)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 2:14 PM
The worm cut through the cave in like a fish through water
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 2:17 PM
"Think there are more down here?" 
(Would Nev know anything about what that worm was, where it originates or whatnot)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 2:19 PM
"...Maybe? But then, what would they do if they met each other face-to-face?"
She shrugs. "If there are, I can Banish them before they get too close, or Lana can polymorph them. As long as nobody gets eaten."
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 2:20 PM
(Anyone can roll nature on purple worms)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 2:20 PM

Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 2:23 PM

Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 4:57 PM
Smutlana would know something about them? He speaks undercommon

John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 5:06 PM
You’ve all heard of purple worms as almost mythical creatures that live deep underground. None of you know any details about their biology 
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 5:08 PM
(So a giant squid, basically)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 5:09 PM
Lol
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 5:51 PM
We're so deep underground. Oof.
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Yesterday at 5:55 PM
Odo exhaustedly expressing
"Dang worm be a bit biggeerr than them worms I'd wolf down from them there mud pies in my younger self's time"
Odo sighs
"I dang well could use a rest.  Wonder if there done be a place where maybe Nevayuhhh could done make that there fancy little hut thing done do take place, but I reckon we wouldn't wanna be in harm’s way before"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 5:57 PM
Kaz rubs at her face. "I think we're safe enough here. The worm's blockin' one end of the tunnel, and Nev'll see anythin' comin' down the other end"
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Yesterday at 6:01 PM
"that wurmm done had beeen a commin’ so fast. ‘Reckon there done not had been a way for us to escape the bigggun wurm." Odo sighs "i done could be a’ usin’ a mush cake and a bit of a breather when we done have a bit of time to take unnnn"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 6:21 PM
(Y'all want to rest here?)
"May I have the alchemy jug?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 6:21 PM
Kaz nods, pulling it out of her Bag of Holding and passing it over
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 6:22 PM
"Thank you."
Nev is going to make wine in the jug and then gargle with some of it for a while.
Aaaand also drink some. It's been a hell of a week.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 7:56 PM
Kaz makes a grabbing motion after a minute or so. She takes the jug from Nev and has a few swigs herself, then passes it back
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 8:18 PM
"We never speak of this again." Looking to the rest of the party while taking one last drink "The captain will never look at me the same again" .... "I'll never look at me the same again."
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 8:22 PM
(If you guys want to take a short rest feel free)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 11:11 PM
Kaz pats Nev on the back. “I don’t look at you any differently. But I won’t tell him”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 11:17 PM
"And that's why you're my friend, Kaz. We can watch a Kenku badger climb up a giant worm anus and still be able to look at each other when we eat breakfast."
"Maybe not right away. But eventually."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 11:53 PM
She snorts with laughter. “Gods, now there’s a sentence I never thought I’d hear. D’you think anyone back home will ever believe any of this?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 12:25 AM
"If I have it my way I'll die with this information." After a minute "I might tell Khim. As an adventuring deterrent, of course."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 8:53 AM
“Oh, of course.” She studies the purple worm’s carcass. “Bet Angela will be impressed we even saw one of these, let alone killed it”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Today at 1:41 PM
“Nevaeh, your watering can please. These gems… um… yeah.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 1:45 PM
She hands over the decanter
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Today at 2:16 PM
Smutlana furtively grabs the decanter and scampers over to the side to wash the gems
“So Odo, connected to that big ol’ stinger is gonna be the venom sac that feeds venom to the stinger. I bet you 5 buttcoins that you can’t find it.”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 2:21 PM
Odo perks up from slanting at the side of the tunnel 
"Ohhh yeahhhhh???"
John Dungeon Master — Today at 5:09 PM
Unfortunately, although you are very athletic and perceptive, you have no idea where the venom gland is or how to harvest it
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 5:12 PM
(Is that nature or medicine?)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Today at 5:23 PM
(If nature, lana rolled NAT 20 with kenku Adv)
(To help find this gland)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 5:26 PM
Odo struggling
"Well I'll be wetter than a hen ...done reckon I’m far from eggcellent can't be a findin that there sack o’ venom ...but I know your eggceptional self Lana can done do find that there sack "
"I be in debt to you that there 5 buttcoins ya done had a mentioned earlier"
John Dungeon Master — Today at 5:28 PM
Ok there is a 70% chance that the venom gland was destroyed as you violently hacked apart the worm’s posterior so just roll a d100 get above 70
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Today at 5:29 PM
(But it had such strong butt armor 😓)
(Well maybe around the actual butt hole it’s a little softer)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 5:30 PM
(But Kaz and Odo cut it up too)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Today at 5:32 PM
(Lacerated worm butthole dripping with venom and plundered by a badger… what have we done? Who have we become?)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 5:54 PM
(hey, that's on you all. I went in unwillingly.)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 6:00 PM
(I didn’t go in at all)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Today at 6:06 PM
(Did Kaz lacerate the butthole?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 6:25 PM
(A bit, yeah)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Today at 7:55 PM
@Odo Falcanspur (Mike) you gotta roll for more buttcoins

Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 7:57 PM
lol
John Dungeon Master — Today at 7:57 PM
Ok lana manages to harvest one dose of purple worm venom
Its not the highest purity so it might not be worth as much to sell but its a powerful poison.
