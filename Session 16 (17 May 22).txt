    • we find a street urchin named Seanin and pay him 5 silver to watch the house during the day
    • Kaz knows that the lower planes are places of pure terror, where you need extreme strength and power to survive. She also knows that being prepared, like having holy water on hand, could help tip the balance in our favor. So we go to procure some holy water.
    • we head to Xosco’s auction house to auction Kaz’s Tome of Clear Thought
        ◦ you must be a member to buy anything at auction. to become a member, you pay a fee and get letters of rec from individuals trusted by the auction house
        ◦ selling anything, the auction house takes a 10% cut. We don’t know when the item will be auctioned, but sometime within the next few weeks
    • We hear a huge base drum in the distance, and see three columns of devils (Beatezu) marching along and chanting “Hail Asmodeus!”
        ◦ the marches have been increasing lately, according to a bystander. The devils march from the Temple of Asmodeus, around the city, and back to the temple
    • We find a cluster of Faerunian temples, including a temple to Selune. Nevaeh is super excited to be in a familiar place so far from home. The priestess at the temple (Asara) is from Neverwinter, but came to Sigil a long time ago. We do some odd jobs for a few hours in exchange for 3 vials of holy water.
    • We walk back toward the safehouse where Seanin is on stakeout. At one point we see a tour group of wealthy Primes on a magic carpet, with a genie tour guide. We also see blue-skinned, red-haired bird people with chicken talons for feet, human hands, and flaming wings. There are plenty of people travelling through the Lady’s Ward in gilded sedan chairs
    • Seanin hasn’t seen anything, so we stake out the portal. We see a group of Costa wearing travelling packs walk through the portal and join the line. They’re hostile, but they don’t attack us, they just question why we want to go to Acaron
        ◦ Acaron – lawful plane with decidedly evil leanings.  Features a branch of the River Styx, which flows to all planes
        ◦ We find out that the portal key is just a piece of paper or parchment with a circle drawn on it in black ink (portal keys are any type of the same object, so any paper with a black circle will work as a key)
    • We emerge from the portal in a huge tower overlooking a vast ruined fortress-factory, with many other towers around us connected by bridges. A gigantic, planet-sized cube hovers in the reddish sky a vast distance away, with geographic features on its surface. Other cubes are perhaps smaller, or perhaps even further away. The whole place is made of polished obsidian.
        ◦ Our tower has a cupola, with one archway forming the portal we just came through
        ◦ Kaz looks through the planar sextant, but doesn’t see any obvious glowing features the way she did in Limbo. She does use the range-finding portion of the tool to discover that the nearest cube is over 1000 miles away
    • We head down the tower. It starts raining as we reach a rubble-covered metal walkway at the bottom, and Kaz uses Shape Water to keep herself and her journal from getting wet. We also find fairly fresh corpses that look like they were blasted apart by humanoids. 
    • Suddenly, an entire group of armed individuals appear on a ledge above us. They demand to know if we’re Karote or Threk. Kaz demands to know what they are, finds out they’re Karote, and bluffs that the party is also Karote and “lost their armbands” to a party of Threk. She manages to pretend she knew where the ladder up to their ledge was all along and guides the party up to meet the Karote.
    • We’re met by a tiefling in a black armband. Kaz asks him if he’s seen the dwarf we’re looking for, and he says that the dwarf and his group tend to stick to the towers
    • Suddenly, arrows fly past us. In the courtyard below us are a group of red-armbanded Threk, who start chasing the Karote. We slip away in the chaos.
    • Zug transforms into a vulture and flies up to scout around. He realizes that the entire fortress-factory is on one face of a cube, several miles long and bordered by walls. In the center is a thicker, more obelisk-shaped tower. Zug sees a humanoid settlement in the distance. He also sees many creatures crawling through the ruins, several of which peel off from a larger patrol and start heading toward Kaz, Odo, and Nevaeh
    • Vulture Zug guides us around the patrol and into a warehouse building (that the patrol specifically went around). Inside are plenty of fresh corpses. Kaz is sketched out and wants to leave, but before the party can escape, heavy footsteps precede an enormous construct around the corner. Its head creaks as it slowly turns to look at the Far-Flung Fellowship.
        ◦ it’s a functional version of the many ruined constructs the factory once produced
