    • We enter into the Lower Ward. In the distance is a giant plume of smoke from the Great Foundry, a huge metalworks complex once run by the Godsmen. The city arcs overhead, with a narrow stripe of sky off over our left shoulders
        ◦ Bloods: Sigil cant for people who are very capable of fighting.
    • We pay a human named Lorch and his halfling partner Nob 1gp to guide us around Sigil
        ◦ both are “Cagers, born and bred” (“The Cage” is another name for Sigil, along with “City of Doors”)
    • Lorch says he can lead us to a door to Mycelia, in Mechanus. Nob says he’s heard of the Vigilant Sentinels
    • We decide to buy armor and other goods before making any other moves. Lorch and Nob take us into the Hive, the slums of Sigil, and try to get us to take a ‘shortcut’ through a suspicious alley. Zug and Odo are onto them and pressure Lorch to take us on a shorter route, but they just run for it and call out to their bandit friends to attack us anyway. 
    • Zug kills Lorch in the battle and resurrects him as a spore servant. After trading a few blows and spells, the rest of the bandits realize that we’re spellslingers and not worth fighting. They run off. Nob tries to follow, but Zug entangles him in mycelia to restrain him
    • We knock Nob out, but a mob has noticed our activities and starts moving after us. We hoof it back out of the Hive and the mob pretty much ignores us after that
        ◦ A little over a decade ago, there was some upheaval in Sigil. There were once factions that performed various government tasks in the city, and the Harmonium faction acted as the police force. After the devastating Faction War, all factions were forced to disband, so now there are just neighborhood militias and the Sons of Mercy (former faction members who act as police, few and far between)
    • We drag Nob to an empty building, wake him up, and interrogate him. He tells us where to go to find the Market Ward, and we leave him terrified and tied up with Heather!Lorch
    • We walk along the inside of the torus towards the Market Ward, along a broad thoroughfare. Lots of buildings along the way are covered in razor-sharp vines.
    • We pass by many Dabus (who serve the Lady of Pain) repairing the city and doing other tasks. They appear to speak to each other (and, rarely, to others) by producing illusory symbols in the air.
    • We see dozens of cranium rats scurrying through the gutters (they’re psionic)
    • We see dozens of humanoids of all sorts – people with elephant trunks and horns and other features. We even see fiends and angels walking through the streets.
    • Berryar – goat-like centaur with ram’s horns. Native to Isgard, one of the most common races of Sigil
    • We pass by the Lady’ Ward, which is filled with palatial buildings and temples, before finally reaching the Market Ward.
    • Marla’s Mageworks: sells colorful armor. Xosco’s auction house could be a good place to auction Kaz’s magic book
    • Kaz tries to find info about the Far Realm, but there isn’t much (certainly nothing in the open)
    • After a day of shopping, we head to the Red Lion Tavern. On the outside is a plaque saying that the building used to be the headquarters of the Independent faction, and continues to be a meeting place for those so inclined
        ◦ Independent Faction: those who didn’t want to join another faction, based in the Great Bazaar because it was the last unclaimed ward
    • We split up in the tavern to look for information. 
        ◦ Nev and Kaz approach a group of Eladrin from the plane Arvandor to ask about the Vigilant Sentinels, and discover that they have a chapter in the Lady’s Ward. 
        ◦ Zug finds out that there’s a door leading to Mechanus in the courthouse that leads to Regulus (the main city of modrons), or we could visit the society of discipline and enlightenment in Mechanus, who maintain a (now out-of-date) list of all the doors in Sigil.
        ◦ Odo swaps war stories with a few strong fighters
    • We rest for the evening in the tavern, wake up the next day and realize it’s now probably about the 18th of Flamerule back home
    • We head to the Great Library of Sigil to do research. It towers ten stories tall, is built of white stone, and is staffed by dabus. We spend the day doing research, and discover…
        ◦ absolutely nothing about either the Far Realm or Excilicor
        ◦ red dragons like Rezzorodrath love gold, are generally evil egomaniacs, breathe fire, and are immune to fire damage. They expect all other creatures to treat them with nothing less than deference.
        ◦ gods are referred to as “powers” in Sigil
        ◦ mindflayers either follow or worship (it’s unclear if it’s philosophy or actual worship) Ilsensein. Ilsensein is one of the powers of the Illithid, has a realm in the outlands called the caverns of thought. It’s reported that sometimes people go there to seek extremely difficult-to-find information, but rarely do they come back sane, if at all. Mindflayers also are said to contact other mysterious powers from beyond the known planes, that no one knows about.
            ▪ there’s a theory that the cranium rats are Ilsensein’s servants, because they’re psionic and can be found throughout the planes
        ◦ The Vigilant Sentinels are an interplanar group committed to the defense of the celestial realms against the machinations of those from the stygian realms. They’re mentioned in the same texts as the Harmonium, who had similar goals. The Vigilant Sentinels are based in Elysium, but have chapters in many major planar cities.
        ◦ Mycelia has delved into one of the gigantic cogs of Mechanus, and there are paths to Mycelia from Regulus
    • We head over to the Lady’s Ward. It’s paved (extremely rare in Faerun, Silverymoon certainly didn’t have paved streets and Waterdeep only had a few), and filled with enormous mansions. There are temples to various deities, some of which we’ve never even heard of (we don’t pass one to Selune, though that doesn’t mean there isn’t one). 
    • We reach the Vigilant Sentinel HQ. Guards man the wall, while two people try to remove demon-written graffiti from the closed gate. Their symbol is a shield with a starburst on it surrounded by seven different types of flowers, with an eye above it.
    • We’re ushered inside by a clean-cut-looking chamberlain. Nevaeh steps forward and asks for Branaris of Krith. The man recognizes the name, and pieces together that Nevaeh is his daughter. He brings us through the verdant temple to the Commandant Athelkara Ovidius, who welcomes us into her office
        ◦ she’s a hulking gray-skinned goliath with a shaved head. She lived most of her life in Iskil, moved to Sigil a few years ago to take on the Commandant position
        ◦ She mentions that Selune and Shar are twin sisters. Shar is the evil twin
    • The Commandant explains that Branaris joined the Vigilant Sentinels about a year previously, and went missing 6-8 months ago from the Vigilant Sentinel HQ
    • According to the Commandant, the Watchful Voyagers were a subchapter of the VS assigned to go to the lower planes & spy on the fiends. Their former captain (Bryndicus Colantha) died, the members went insane and started accusing the celestial members (particularly Branaris) of being traitors. The Commandant says that the Watchful Voyagers likely kidnapped Branaris (along with his things??)
        ◦ Bryndicus Colantha supposedly died in a fiend ambush, as reported by the Watchful Voyagers
        ◦ Lord Querial (lord commander of the VS) told the WV to drop their accusations
    • WV known to have safehouses in the Lower Planes and in Sigil. A messenger visits the one in Sigil (guild hall ward) from time-to-time
    • The Commandant notes that the Vigilant Sentinels have had their resources stretched thin by meaningless wars, famines, and disasters in the Prime material worlds, which have all been increasing over the past year. Fiendish activities in the Prime worlds has been increasing across the board, and she thinks that the fiends might be behind that
    • We get street food for dinner – celestial-shaped pastries and fiend-shaped meat skewers. Kaz wonders if you’re supporting one or the other by buying their likeness, or insulting them by biting their head off. Odo buys 10 of each and mashes them into one big ball.
    • We stake out the Watchful Voyager safehouse in Sigil. Zuggtboy Wildshapes into a rat and sneaks into the empty building, finds out that three people had been sleeping in the building at some point within the past year (though two bedrolls were rolled up). He goes downstairs, finds a human with a sword reading a book by candlelight
    • About three hours after the stakeout begins, a dwarf slips down the street, does a secret knock on the door, and enters. Kaz sneaks up to the side of the house and casts Detect Thoughts to skim both people’s surface thoughts
        ◦ Dwarf’s surface thoughts are “I need to remember all this information he’s giving me. Better write it down” Writes down stuff he’s hearing, something about fiends in Sigil, sightings of specific named devils, something about negotiations with yugoloths (a type of fiend that is neither devil nor demon)
        ◦ Human feels nervous, like relating this information is dangerous for him but he just wants to get this job done
    • The human and the dwarf leave after about an hour. The dwarf walks to the archway of an aqueduct, pulls out a piece of parchment, and disappears through a doorway.
