    • The party drags themselves back into the ship. The crew is frantically trying to fix the damage and stop the ship from taking on water. Lana casts magic to control the water around her and force it out of the ship. Kaz helps where she can, and loans her fish suit out to the crew so someone can go outside and fix the damage.
    • We all return to the bridge. The chief engineer is on the bridge reporting the damage when we arrive. The ship is able to still move, at least, and we rest for an hour as we continue
    • The kelp forest of Zaradakar becomes darker and denser. The kelp fronds scrape against the ship as we go. Every now and then, we see a glimpse of something curved through the fronds. It’s obvious that the aboleths put their temple in the densest part of the forest.
        ◦ Kaz looks through the planar sextant, but doesn’t see any weird energy currents. She helps Dareth Silvershield navigate with it and with his arcanomechanical map.
    • We emerge into a clearing, facing a mountain-sized iceberg. The ship gets caught in some of the kelp around the clearing. Smutlana sees a door in the iceberg carved to look like a maw, probably a thousand feet away. We decide to put our fish suits on and swim towards the opening.
    • The maw-door is circular, beneath three carved eyeballs stacked vertically on top of each other and staring down at us. The maw seems to funnel down into the rock. Neither Nevaeh nor Kaz can see through the darkness inside, and Nevaeh’s light spells fail to illuminate anything. Kaz casts Intellect Fortress on the party, and we swim forward into the belly of the beast.
    • We swim blindly until we emerge into air. We can see a purple-ish glow (almost like black light) emitting from the ice walls and illuminating a pool around us. There’s a stupendous crash behind us, and we gather that the tunnel we came through has collapsed.
        ◦ Feels like we were allowed through that tunnel.
    • We take our fish suits off and put them in the bag of holding, then walk on. The ground is wet, and there’s a pronounced ozone smell. The tunnels are maze-like, with no rhyme or reason. The walls are covered in glowing and pulsating alien glyphs. Kaz uses the Rod of Understanding on herself, hoping the glyphs are signposts. They’re not signposts. In fact, they don’t seem to be a language (or, if they are, it’s one that’s so eldritch that even Comprehend Languages can’t help)
    • Nev tries to touch the glyphs and feels like something other than her mind is screaming inside her mind. She quickly withdraws her hand. She also recalls that temples are often consecrated in ways that can affect certain creatures or block magical transportation (like the House of the Moon preventing fiends from entering). Because this is an aboleth temple, we might not be able to teleport or planeshift out.
    • We make our way through hundreds of feet of tunnels. There’s a constant low thrumming sound that seems to come from all around us. Occasionally, we come to forks in the road, or pass branching tunnels. After we turn left at one fork, we see a smear of partially dried bluish liquid on the wall to our right. Kaz carefully takes a sample and stores it in one of her glass bottles. Looking at it, she thinks that the smear’s shape reminds her of blood.
    • Eventually, the hallway opens up into a chamber with long translucent purple crystals embedded in the walls. Occasionally, one will flash with light. They look similar to the crystals in the Rod of Drosys, but not quite the same. Odo tries to scrape off a bit of one of the crystals and it flashes brightly. He feels a pulse and a horrified scream echo through his mind, but manages to shake off the effects.
        ◦ Kaz telepathically reaches out to the crystal and apologizes for Odo’s behavior, promising that the party won’t try to hurt the crystals. There’s no obvious response.
        ◦ As we walk through the cave, more crystals flash. We see and hear flashes of tritons being tortured by aboleths in our minds. Lana, Kaz, and Nev are frightened, but Lana’s symbiont manages to calm her down. Once we leave the room, the fear seems to abate.
            ▪ Lana intuits that the images seemed more like a phenomenon than intentional communication.
    • We continue forward into another chamber, and see an alien face peek around the corner and look at us, then dart back with a gibbering cackle.
    • We follow it through the tunnel, whereupon it drops down from the ceiling and tries to bite Kaz’s neck. She jumps back and blasts it apart on instinct. There are no humanoid organs inside, only strange writhing tubes, whitish liquid, greenish liquid, and blackish liquid.
        ◦ It’s definitely aberrant, and reminds us of the strange creatures we fought in the Uvorin Decemvirate lab.
    • We make our way further into the tunnels, past more pulsating runes and symbols. At one point, we realize we’ve gone in a bit of a circle and have to try new paths until we start moving upward. We get more and more of a creepy feeling as we continue.
    • We travel along a long, straight tunnel with many smaller tunnels funneling into it. At the end of the tunnel is an open doorway into a much, much larger room. Nev peeks inside and sees a 150ft wide 7-sided polygonal room with a domed ceiling covered in spiralling patterns and colorful runes. The floor is covered in concentric circles with the same writing, and seems to have some sort of circular hatch in the floor. On the far wall, there’s a sort of balcony recessed into the wall where a gallery of people (or other things) could sit and look down on the room, with further tunnels leading out. The room itself is empty. She suspects it’s some kind of ceremonial or ritual space.
    • We all cautiously enter the room. Kaz has a white-knuckled grip on the Rod of Drosys. Kaz looks around with the planar sextant, but doesn’t see anything.
    • Suddenly, we hear a voice from behind a pillar near the balcony. “Hello. I’m a human, I’m unarmed, and I’m here to talk to you. I ask that you hold your peace so I can come out.” We judge that the speaker is sincere and allow it.
    • A man steps out from behind the pillar. He’s wearing a fairly nicely tailored suit – a sable doublet and trousers, with some velvet trim and silver fastenings. His face bears a striking resemblance to Odo, and he says “My name is Owen Falcanspur.” Kaz can see that he’s no shapechanger or under an illusion spell. He looks down at Odo. “You are clearly Odo. Did you know that you had a twin brother, Odo?”
        ◦ Odo confirms that he knows he had a brother, and seems to be in shock along with the rest of the party. Owen steps off the balcony and floats down to our level. Odo opens his arms for a hug, but Owen just looks puzzled by the gesture. “It is remarkable. The resemblance”
    • Odo reaffirms that he’s always wanted a brother, and introduces the rest of the party (sans Kaz, who asks him telepathically not to introduce her). Owen explains he was sent away before his second birthday, but it was to his benefit as he was given wizardly training and acquired great power in the realm of his upbringing, “the greatest place to study magic in the planes”. He also explains that we’re trapped by the people pursuing us, that he hasn’t seen any portal in the temple, and that the artifact we came to destroy cannot be destroyed. He claims he can get us out, but that he’ll need that artifact in exchange.
        ◦ Kaz immediately decides that she will NOT give up the mirror.
    • Odo tries to convince Owen to come home with him and meet the rest of his family. Lana tells Odo that now’s not the time for catching up, and Odo protests that that’s his brother. Kaz asks him who’s following us, and he just says “I think you know”
        ◦ Owen explains he was seconded to search for the artifact, but he’s not the one seeking it himself. He’s instead seeking it for his own master. We gather that he doesn’t have complete information about what it is he’s seeking. He also tries to convince Odo to come to the dark side with him. Odo asks who his master is, and he pulls out a symbol of Asmodeus.
    • Odo cries at the unfairness of what’s happened to Owen, even though Owen says not to pity him. Owen continues to press for “the artifact” and claims that if we give it up we can break his contract. Lana steps in and outright tells him “We don’t make deals with devils.” Owen looks frustrated, but keeps his reactions tightly controlled. “Odo, I promise you, I’m going to fix your mind, and then you’ll be a strong and mighty servant of Asmodeus”
    • Asger steps out onto the balcony, followed by several snakelike Lamia nobles. “Hah! I told you that they were recalcitrant” he cries. He orders one of the Lamia to cast a spell across the balcony, which creates a force field across the opening above us. Owen calmly says “Remember, I want Odo alive.” Asger ignores him, speaking directly to us. “I promised an old friend I’d let him have first crack at you. Well, here he is!” He pulls out a spell scroll and reads it. A summoning circle appears on the floor, and a HUGE red claw reaches through and smashes onto the floor. Rezzoradrath the Ashmaker pulls himself into the temple, looks down at us, and grins. “Now is the time for my vengeance” he says, and breathes fire over the party.
        ◦ Kaz and Odo both get a nat20 and it’s still not enough to save against 96 damage of fire breath. Nev is immediately reduced to 0. Kaz’s Gift of the Protectors kicks in and the eldritch runes around her pulse with power.
        ◦ Asger looks down at us and laughs as he watches us fight. Owen stands solemnly with his hands behind his back.
    • 
    • Odo: “I’m gonna take you down like I took down Lorgash, Unsarrek, and Merto!”
      Rezzoradrath gets pissed when he says that.
    • As we battle Resoradrath, he starts to look bloody. He’s no longer interested in just batting us around on the ground – instead, he flies up to the roof and roasts everyone he can reach with his fire breath. Asger is laughing hysterically and slapping his thigh. Owen is still poker-faced. The lamias are just watching
        ◦ lamias aren’t fiends, they’re monstrosities
    • Smutlana turns herself into a giant eagle, grabs Odo, and flies him up as high as she can. Odo launches himself the final ten feet and grabs onto Resoradrath’s leg. Resoradrath whips Odo off with his tail, and Odo falls unconscious and to the ground. 
    • Nev blasts Resoradrath with a guiding bolt, CRITS, and hits him so hard he looks nervous. Asger stops laughing and clapping, looking disappointed. Resoradrath calls out “Asger Mordelin, where’s the portal?” Asger just looks disappointed in Resoradrath and shrugs. Resoradrath goes absolutely berzerk and divebombs Nevaeh, knocking her unconscious as well
    • Kaz sees Resoradrath tail whip Nevaeh to death and loses it. She runs to the center of the room and all the light drains from the sigils on the walls into the sigils on the floor around her. She weaves together all three bolts of her eldritch blast and launches them into Resoradrath with a scream of rage and fear and protectiveness. Resoradrath plummets to the ground, dead.
        ◦ Asger yells out “no!”, disappointed. Owen is stroking his goatee thoughtfully.
    • The room is now knee-deep in water, melted from Resoradrath’s breath. Asger makes a sweeping gesture and drops the forcefield in front of himself. “Alright. They’re weakened. Get the mirror.” He tries to cast a spell to bubble himself somehow, but Kaz counterspells it and enrages him.
    • Kaz, Lana, and Odo feel the ice beneath their feet is suddenly gone and they’re in the water. Surfacing beside us is an ancient creature of eldritch terror. The aboleth speaks telepathically to everyone in the room. “You have all violated the sanctum sanctorum. Now you will pay!” A blinding purplish light washes out around us, a rift in reality opens, and HUGE tentacles start to push through the gap.
    • Kaz sees the rift open up and knows the gods are smiling upon her. She reaches into her bag and pulls out the mirror, then looks Asger dead in the eyes and says “Fuck you Asger Mordelin.” She turns and hurls the mirror into the rift. It immediately disintegrates. Asger screams out in rage and horror. “Kill them! Kill them all!”
        ◦ Owen doesn’t seem to know the significance of the mirror, other than that it’s something Asger wants.
    • An enormous, tentacled horror crawls its way through the rift and onto the balcony. The lamia on the balcony blanch and look terrified of the star spawn approaching them. Asger looks around at what’s happening and says “Fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK! Get us the fuck out of here!” and the lamia start teleporting away. The tentacle beast grabs several of the less lucky ones in its tentacles and drags them into its maws.
    • Asger looks back at Kaz, furious. “Kasma Talfen!” he yells, before casting Raulothim’s Psychic Lance at her. She staggers, incapacitated, but shakes off most of the psychic damage. When she looks back, both Owen and Asger are gone.
    • The aboleth sees Kaz messing with its portal and tries to enslave her, but she manages to throw off the charm thanks to her fey ancestry. Kaz responds by overloading its mind with psychic energy, running away, and calling the rest of the party to her so we can Planeshift out.
        ◦ the aboleth saved, so no madness :,(
    • the aboleth casts a spell on Nev to reduce her intelligence to 1. She can’t speak or make plans and her intelligence modifier is -5, though she remembers that the party members are her friends.
    • Kaz tries to Planeshift the party out, but the aboleth counterspells it. We start to see the water boil around us. We fight on until a sudden geyser-like blast surges up between us and the aboleth. We find ourselves standing on the nose of the Starglimmer as it surfaces through the watery shaft.
    • As we flee toward the weapons hatches where the crew are frantically beckoning to us, the aboleth blasts us with one last psychic wave. Odo, Lana, and Nev all collapse, unconsious. The crew helps Kaz drag the rest of her party to the hatches. Kaz jumps down into the hatch last and watches the water surge over the air envelope above her head. The aboleth’s tentacles lash out toward the fleeing ship as the hatch seals shut.







Bonus
(the homebrew spell Kaz used to overload the aboleth’s mind)
