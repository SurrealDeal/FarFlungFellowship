    • The new Tash’gar is some sort of mutated troll, even bigger and uglier than the old Tash’gar
    • As Odo moves in to attack Tash’gar, the rest of the party sees spectral werebear figures gather around him in support
    • Nevaeh casts Twilight Sanctuary and de-charms the kenku. They look disoriented and unsure.
    • Kaz trained very hard after the party got back from Agathys, and can now cast three Eldritch Blast bolts per turn
    • Tash’gar, pissed that the party is slashing him faster than he can heal, whirls around and slashes everyone in the room. He gouges nasty wounds into the party and absolutely eviscerates the kenku
    • Kaz gets the killing blow on Tash’gar. The whole party gives the dead kenku last rites.
    • Kaz goes upstairs to search for information about Ranjat and his whole operation. The second floor was where the kenku slept (on the floor). The third floor was Tash’gar’s and it’s full of rotting, partially-eaten carcasses. Lana joins Kaz and finds a map of our neighborhood, with our house marked with an X and guard patrol routes noted
        ◦ Before going upstairs, Lana sees a little purple devil looking through the door. It poofs away when it realizes it’s been spotted. She and Odo warn the rest of the party that they’d better hurry up before company arrives.
    • As Lana and Kaz explore upstairs, Odo spots armored figures with halbeards approaching. Assuming it’s the Sons of Mercy, the party plans to run before they’re spotted. Kaz teleports out with Odo, but Ranjat appears and attacks Lana before she and Nevaeh can fly out themselves.
    • Lana casts Gaseous Form on herself and seeps through a window. Ranjat hurls a spell at her and yells “It’s drifting away! After it!” Kaz and Odo hear him yell and start running back towards the house. Odo pulls himself onto a roof and sees a bunch more of Ranjat’s tiny demon minions.
    • Ranjat casts fly on himself and pursues Lana, who’s turned herself into an owl. He blasts her out of the air and she falls down through a roof and lands, dazed and nearly dead. Kaz feels the tug of magic as Gift of the Protectors kicks in and quietly starts to panic.
    • Lana’s hat drifts slowly down, and she snatches it out of the air as she climbs back onto the roof. Two tieflings watch her climb out, shocked and horrified that a kenku has fallen into their dining room. Ranjat swoops down toward her, going in for the kill.
    • Scared that Lana is nearly dead and estimating her location from the loud BANG of her fall, Kaz teleports to reach her.
    • Kaz desperately tries to trap Ranjat in a Mental Prison while Lana heals, but as in every previous encounter, her magic slides off of him. Unable to stab him with her rainbow dagger, she changes tack and shoots a handful of sparks into Ranjat’s face, giving Odo more opportunity to cut him down.
    • “What’s wrong, pussycat? I’ve got something for you meow (now)” – Odo, to Ranjat, who’s looking rough
    • Ranjat’s meragon minions finally arrive and Ranjat orders them to attack the party. They’re six feet tall and swole, wearing armor and carrying halbeards.
    • Odo finally shoves Ranjat to the ground and cleaves his head from his body. His last expression is of surprise, snuffing out his roar of anger before his body bursts into a cloud of dust.
    • The meragons follow Ranjat’s order to “kill the kenku” and slash Lana to death. Kaz runs in, grabs what she can of Ranjat’s stuff, grabs Lana’s body, and Dimension Doors away with the last of her borrowed power
        ◦ Kaz gets a scroll of Regenerate, a potion of speed, and a potion of Supreme Healing with a NAT 20 dex check.
    • Odo grabs Ranjat’s sword (a Nine Lives Stealer), then he and Nevaeh leap from the roof and eventually rejoin Kaz. Nev revives Lana, and both she and Kaz hug Lana.
    • A group of flying demons (synegons) follow the Far Flung Fellowship and fling superheated spines at them as they catch their breath. Lana casts Pass Without A Trace and the party darts into a covered alleyway, hoping to lose their pursuers in the maze of streets. They manage to stay just ahead of the synegons, slip around a corner, shoot through an open door, and watch as their pursuers search fruitlessly for them.
    • As the party hides and heals, they see Stinkmaggot walking back toward the safehouse. Kaz telepathically directs him toward their hiding place and Lana explains that they killed Ranjat. Stinkmaggot is sad to hear that all the other kenku except Twilight died, but realizes that Ranjat’s minions lurk nearby and offers to guide them safely out of the Hellgate district. 
        ◦ Stinkmaggot gets renamed Luna.
    • Luna leads us through covered alleyways, tunnels, buildings, and other hidden areas until we reach the Lady’s Ward again. We return to Lady Renalia’s place, Luna and Twilight catch each other up, and we offer to take them back to our home.
    • Kaz asks Luna and Twilight if anyone else knew about their home’s location. Luna explains that “the master didn’t want anyone else to know.” Smutlana’s escape was humiliating to Ranjat. Also, there was some sort of new potion or dust or something that Lana received before she went on her last mission for Ranjat, SUPPOSEDLY to prevent demonic possession.
    • Lana asks WHY she was supposed to be protected from demons on her mission. Luna explains that they were told Calimport was a nest of spies of all kinds, and that Ranjat didn’t want demons spying on him (all demons, including Ranjat, are enemies of each other). Ranjat served the Hells, but Luna didn’t know which specific master.
    • Luna relays that Ranjat was in Sigil meeting other demons about the Blood War. He doesn’t know what they were meeting about, but he says he occasionally saw demons and devils meeting without fighting (he doesn’t know what type of demons/devils).
    • We take Luna and Twilight home. Kaz goes out to buy reagents from the market. Odo comes along. He considers selling Ranjat’s sword despite it’s value, because it makes him uncomfortable.
    • While Kaz and Odo are gone, one of our front windows gets smashed in. Lana goes to check it out and finds two little kids looking shocked and guilty. One runs off, the other apologizes through his terror. Lana learns that they’re brothers and both live next door.
    • Lana and Nev go next door to reassure the family that everything is okay. They meet the boys’ mother, Nashaen Argesso. Her husband is Julian, a merchant. Both are from Faerun. They’d never had the opportunity to meet us since we’re gone a lot
        ◦ Lambert “Bert” Argesso is 10. Cloris “Lori” Argesso is 7. They also have a 9-year-old sister named Willa.
    • Zeferio placed a permanent Sanctum spell on the fortress such that no one could scry inside it.

(Can I say I did a commune before we went to sleep that first night we got back? when the window got broken? cuz I think in-game we're on the next day already?)
John Dungeon Master — 11/25/2022 9:58 AM
Sure
You just were going to take a long rest and then it will be Eleasis 30
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 11/25/2022 9:59 AM
yeah, okay ty
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 11/25/2022 5:52 PM
(Ooh what are you gonna ask? Or do you keep it private?)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 11/25/2022 9:09 PM
(i got so busy today I totally forgot about this lol)
Okay, so first I want to try Divine Intervention to find out 'Exactly where we need to go in The Abyss to get the most information on Fredryk.
dang so close lol
John Dungeon Master — 11/25/2022 9:13 PM
Yeah close!
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 11/25/2022 9:14 PM
okay fiiiine we'll figure it out like regular people
I needed 11 or lower, and got a 15
Okay, my commune questions for the night:
Is there a any substantial link with the Mythallar and Fredryk?
John Dungeon Master — 11/25/2022 9:19 PM
No
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 11/25/2022 9:19 PM
Great, ended that chain of questions haha
John Dungeon Master — 11/25/2022 9:19 PM
Actually she says:
much darkness obscures our vision of both but 
Not to the best of our knowledge
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 11/25/2022 9:25 PM
Okay that's fair
kind of helped squash my second question too lol
Is there insight that Ganth has about my father's disappearance that we haven't utilized yet? (when he was asking questions at the time I had no idea what to ask in return)
And I think my last question: Are the Eladrin actively looking for my father? (From what I could gather they didn't have a lot of info on what happened after he left and may have been salty about the whole thing so just wrote him off?)
John Dungeon Master — 11/25/2022 9:37 PM
The answer to the question about Ganth is: our vision of him is clouded
And finally, your Father’s Eladrin companions earnestly seek his return, but have run out of leads
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 12:14 PM
Hearing that we're planning on heading to Ranjat's townhouse, before we leave, Nev is going to use Divination to ask a question about our plan: "We believe we know where Ranjat's townhouse is, and we're planning on going there today. Will we be walking into a trap?"
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 1:05 PM
The answer you get is “expect deadly peril”
