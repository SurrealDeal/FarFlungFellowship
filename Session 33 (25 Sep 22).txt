    • Kaz goes to the library and researches baatezu, tenar’ri, and yugoloths. She also researches Othrys (and Carceri in general).
        ◦ Yugoloths are mostly found in Hades and Gehenna (thought to be native to Hades). Hire themselves out as Mercenaries on both sides of the blood war, and tend to keep their contracts. Incredibly guileful, cunning, manipulative. 
        ◦ Carceri is also known as Tartarus. Like the other lower planes, the River Styx flows through it and can be used to travel from one plane to another. Carceri can act as a giant prison – once something is imprisoned there, it can’t leave (it’s possible to leave if you haven’t been imprisoned, it’s just hard). A particular group of godlike entities called Titans are imprisoned there.
            ▪ Favored theory: if you’re sent there with the intent to imprison you by something more powerful than you, you’re stuck there until you become more powerful than whatever imprisoned you.
            ▪ Has 6 layers: Othrys (fetid swamp), Cathris (poison jungle), Menethes (endless desert), Colothes (jagged sloping mountains, no flat terrain), Porphates (endless dark ocean), Agathys (almost uncharacterized, believed to be an icy wasteland. very dangerous)
            ▪ leans toward the chaotic end of the spectrum (petitioners who go there are chaotic enough to be evil, but not chaotic enough to believe they should be free (which helps trap them on the plane)
        ◦ Gareleth are a species of fiend. Working theory is that a being called Apombs created them. Plenty of conflicting lore on what they are. They enjoy acting as self-appointed wardens, act trapped but can leave if they wish. They have an eternal feud with the yugoloths.
    • We warn our staff that they might be vulnerable living in our unwarded house without us there, and they agree to stay elsewhere for the two-ish weeks we’ll be on the Prime Material
    • Nev visits Priestess Asara and they gossip about Priestess Asara’s date with Lady Renalia’s guard captain
        ◦ Priestess Asara grew up in Neverwinter when it was a ruin and aberrations were crawling out of the ground and attacking people. She and her brother found their way through a portal to Sigil about 19 years ago (she was 13 years old).
    • Kaz casts Sending to Angela and her dad that evening, updating them on her life. They’re both happy to hear from her :D
    • Nev casts Commune, learns that Fredryk originally came from the Abyss. She also asks if we can trust the information Ganth provided us in his last visit, and gets a “yes and no” in response. Finally, she asks if we can find more information on Fredryk in Carceri, and learns that we cannot.
    • Nev also casts Divination and learns that Eudora and Jevrin will be safe if we leave for the next seven days
    • We rest for the evening, then head to the portal to Neverwinter about 20 minutes from our house. The portal key is a metal spoon, and it leads to the archway of a ruined stone building in the clearing of a pine forest. We walk along the trail out of the forest and into a plain with rolling hills. We occasionally pass small villages, until eventually we see Neverwinter.
    • The city itself is bustling, scaffolding around buildings damaged when the Spellplague happened and the Chasm spat out plane-touched aberrations into the city. We follow the river on the south bank until we reach the House of Knowledge (temple to Ogma, the god of Knowledge), where “Uncle Jasper” is staying. Words of wisdom are carved into the walls, and busts of famous philosophers are placed around the room
        ◦ Kaz copies a page out of her journal and leaves it as an offering at the temple’s shrine. Nev leaves a blank sheet of parchment, since the priests appreciate the resources. Lana leaves a recipe for vegan balsamic vinegar ginger marinated mushroom kebabs
    • A monk goes and finds Jasper (a gnome) upstairs, and he comes down to meet us. He hugs Nev and Odo around their knees, then greets Kaz and Lana warmly. He takes us to a nearby tavern, The White Dove, filled with a bunch of academics and philosophers, and Nev and Odo take turns filling Jasper in on everything that’s happened with us and with Branaris. Jasper is stunned to hear about the planes we’ve been to, and about Sigil, and Kaz chimes in to share more about those places. He encourages infodumping, and Kaz loves to infodump, so the sharing goes on for a while.
        ◦ Jasper’s specialty is in Divination magic
        ◦ Jasper tends to travel between Waterdeep/Falcon’s Roost, Neverwinter, and Silverymoon. Kaz excitedly asks him if he’s ever met Davor Tinkerreach, but he says he hasn’t (different fields of study, go figure)
    • It turns out that Jasper has a teleportation circle engraved in the floor of Falcon’s Roost, so he can take us right there. We decide to visit Priestess Jasmine, the eladrin head priestess of the Hallowed Temple to Selune in Neverwinter, to say hello to her from Priestess Asara
    • Before we leave, Odo tells Jasper about the “family curse” that took his older sibling and that Othar doesn’t want Odo to go to the lower planes because of it. Jasper is shocked, as Othar never told him about any of it, and encourages Odo to talk with his father about it
    • We visit the Hallowed Temple. Nevaeh gets treated like a celebrity since she’s a Moonstar and her ancestor was an avatar of Selune. We introduce ourselves to Priestess Jasmine and Nev catches her up on Asara’s life (and love life). Priestess Jasmine invites us to her parlor for tea.
    • Priestess Jasmine is an eladrin native to the Feywild. She’s curious to learn that Nev’s father was an eladrin as well, and relates that Gale eladrin having kids is apparently rare.
        ◦ She lived in the city when Mt. Potenal erupted about 50 years ago and devastated the city. It triggered seismic activity that ripped open an enclave of things that had been affected by the Spellplague. Both events devastated and depopulated the city
        ◦ fae eladrin aren’t bound by the same rules as celestial eladrin, and can use their magic openly outside their home plane. They’re not as powerful as celestial eladrin, however.
    • We visit a bunch of tourist sites, including the enormous ruined Castle Never and a few magical and mechanical shops, before we head back to Jasper in the evening. He teleports all of us to Falcon’s Roost, then teleports himself back to Neverwinter
        ◦ Lana encourages Odo to confront his father about his fiend-abducted sibling
    • We sleep, then ride out to Waterdeep the next day and spend the next evening in Nevaeh’s apartment. Kaz tries to cast Contact Other Plane, but the strain is too great and she’s rendered insane for the rest of the evening. The rest of the party takes good care of her while she babbles word salad at them. The next morning, she wakes up sane, but with a raging headache
    • We head to the House of the Moon and visit Zora Halfill, a werecat woman who often accompanies Priestess of High Moonlight, Jesselia Redenthorp (nee Moonstar). Nevaeh wants to ask Zora to borrow a reliquary for her spellcasting since we’re going to the lower planes. Zora agrees to go outside the proper channels to procure a reliquary, but says that Jesselia wants to speak with Nevaeh alone.
    • Nev explains her situation to Jesselia, who casts a spell to check that she’s not possessed. She asks Nev to open her mind without resisting and casts another spell, then asks “Are you in league with any fiends?” Nev truthfully answers no. “Are you loyal to the Moon Maiden, to the House of the Moon, and to me?” Nev answers yes.
        ◦ “are you loyal to me?” wtf the fuck?? zero trust
        ◦ Nevaeh was scared shitless throughout the encounter, despite having reassured Odo that Jesselia wasn’t scary
    • Nev passes the test, and Jesselia allows her to take a reliquary without paying a deposit (surprisingly). Sora comes up to us as we’re about to leave and passes on a warning from Jesselia: make sure not to lose the reliquary in the lower planes.
    • We go to see Othar. He’d heard of Odo’s exploits in Womford, and was somewhat disappointed that Odo had “dishonored the family name” by crossing the bridge despite orders. He was glad that Odo wasn’t recognized. He also updates the party that the orcs and goblins haven’t been doing well in the war, though they do have a pair of blue dragons that Sir Gondrian and his men are on a mission to stop. They’re led by some powerful mage, whose name Othar doesn’t know.
    • Odo asks about how Tammy is doing in paladin training. Othar is still unsupportive. Nev checks him a couple times, and Odo voices his support for Tammy as well. Lana points out that Tammy has adventuring in her blood, and Kaz notes that Tammy was doing well in training when we went to see her.
        ◦ Lana suggests that Othar go help Tammy train, and he seems somewhat receptive.
    • Othar encourages Odo to come home, since if Tammy’s going out as a paladin, Odo should wrap up his adventure and stay safe. Odo says that he’s promised to find Branaris and he won’t be back until he’s fulfilled that promise. Othar acquiesces, but not without a final warning. “There are powerful forces in this universe we live in. You upset the wrong forces, and you don’t stand a chance. You just stay clear of those hells”
    • Lana asks Othar if he’s ever heard of werebears. Othar looks directly at Lana for a split second, then says “lycanthropy?” Odo covers by bringing up Emmealot, the “gorgeous” werebear working with the Watchful Voyagers. Othar says he knows about lycanthropy, and has encountered several werecats around the city.
    • Odo asks where his mom is, and Othar says she’s out visiting friends. Kaz doesn’t think he’s lying about it.
    • Odo asks to speak with his father alone, and the rest of us bid Othar goodbye and agree to come for dinner. Odo confesses that he’s going to the hells to look for Branaris, and when Othar gets mad, Odo demands to know why he can’t go to the hells. Othar deflects and asks why a celestial like Branaris would be in the Hells. They argue about that for a bit.
        ◦ Kaz senses that Othar doesn’t know the difference between the lower planes in general and the Nine Hells specifically 
    • The party planned in advance to listen through the door and help Odo with the interrogation. Kaz telepathically tells Odo that Othar is deflecting about the curse, and encourages him to pry and ask why his family, specifically, was cursed. Othar gets even more pissed at the accusation that he’d make a deal with a fiend, and Odo basically says “I’m going to the hells regardless. If you don’t tell me everything, then I might die there.” Othar is quiet for a long moment, then beckons Odo closer and whispers in his ear (which the rest of the party can’t hear, but Kaz desperately presses herself to the door to try to hear it anyway)
        ◦ John was laughing so hard at our collective interrogation technique that he had to turn off his camera for a moment (also so he wouldn’t give Othar’s reactions away)
        ◦ Mike and John then went into a separate secret chat to finish up the whispered conversation. Family secrets are (presumably) exchanged.
    • Eventually, we hear Othar speak up at a normal volume again. “Do you have anything else you want to talk about son?” 
      Odo responds “No sir. I appreciate that we were able to talk.” 
      Othar huffs. “I know you’re close with those friends of yours, and with Nevaeh. They can’t know about this, you understand? Promise me.” Odo promises.
    • Odo’s mother and sisters return and we have dinner with the family, then retire to Nevaeh’s apartment.
    • Kaz tells Odo that we heard him promise his father that Odo wouldn’t tell us what Othar said, and that she wouldn’t ask him to break a promise to his father. She just wants to know if he’s okay, and if he’s actually at risk of any curse when he goes to the hells. He says that he’s doing fine, and that he’s at no greater risk than the rest of the party in the lower planes.
    • Kaz casts Contact Other Plane before going to bed. This time, she’s successful.
        ◦ Are you trapped in the Conduit?:  no
        ◦ Does using the Conduit hurt you?:  yes
        ◦ Do you know who made the Conduit?:  no 
        ◦ Do you know where the Conduit was made?:  no
        ◦ Do you know why the Conduit was made?:  no
        ◦ Before the connection drops, Exilicor asks Help? Kaz responds “Of course I’m trying to help ye, but I’m not sure how.” She feels Exilicor searching her mind, as if trying to make sense of a concept that’s incredibly alien and difficult for them. Finally, she gets the response Thank and the connection terminates
    • Nev slips out during the night, goes to visit her mother’s grave, and Communes with Selune.
        ◦ Is Mom happy?:  yes
        ◦ Will it be dangerous for us to bring specifically Odo to Carceri?:  no
        ◦ Could it be possible for an incubus to have angel wings for any other reason than being a risen fiend?:  No. Not without trickery.
    • The next morning is the 21st of Eliasus. We have ten days until the full moon on the first of Eliant, and we know it’ll take us a day to get back to the Loop Woods.
    • We consider trying to find out who hired Sir Gondrian, in the hope of finding out more about his mission and if the powerful mage he and his Gallavanters are hunting is Asger Mordelon. We know that the Open Lord or the Masked Lords could have hired the Gallavanters for the war, but we know we aren’t likely to get ahold of any of them to ask.
        ◦ The Open Lord is the chief executive of Waterdeep (and the public face of the government). The current Open Lord is Lady Lyrel Silverhand. The rest of the government is made up of the anonymous Masked Lords
    • Nev asks Jasper to ask Sir Gondrian about whatever mage Sir Gondrian is hunting. Jasper does so, then lets Nev know that Sir Gondrian was surprised by the question, but the mage goes by The Death Prince
    • Looking for adventuring work to pass the time, we head to the Yawning Portal tavern, which holds the entryway to Undermountain, the largest interconnected dungeon complex on the continent. The tavern is three stories tall and each story looks down into the Undermountain. It’s full of adventurers
        ◦ Undermountain is the remains of the Melerkin dwarvish settlement from thousands of years ago, interconnected by natural caves and other delvings. At its deepest point, it’s ruled over by a powerful wizard named Halastur Blackcloak, who cultivates an ecosystem of evil and dangerous people and monsters, including the Waterdelvian Shar cultists (formerly led by Lord Vanarak Moonstar, until he was convinced to give up and destroy himself).
    • Odo introduces us to a rich-looking party of adventurers, hoping to get hired and paid. The lead adventurer is snobbish, but he agrees to speak with us since Odo is of noble birth. He says he’s about to head into Undermountain, but we’re welcome to “pick up any scraps of treasure he leaves behind.” Nev recognizes the insignia of the House of Tesper, and assumes the snob must be Tannerick Tesper, son of the Lord Edrick Tesper leading the war effort right now.
        ◦ “Ugh, he’s worse than Theo” Kaz mutters to herself in Elvish
    • Tannerick gets Lana to buy him and his friends drinks, implies that Lana is Odo’s slave and that Kaz is either his maid or his mistress. Nev mentions that she ran into his father near Womford, Tannerick looks at her shield and seems to realize that she’s the priestess from the rumors, and that she and the rest of the party must have been the ones to slay the goblin warlord. He tries to brush off the achievement by saying “it was only a goblin.” We ask why he’s not with his father on the frontlines and openly imply that he’s a coward. He and the rest of his party leave the table and head down into the Undermountain, trying to save face.
        ◦ Kaz casts Prestidigitation on Tannerick to make it look like he shit his pants. He doesn’t notice, but a few other patrons do and hide snickers behind their hands. She also finishes the expensive booze they ordered and left on the table.
        ◦ Odo uses Know Your Enemy and learns that Tannerick is a level 1 fighter with a lower strength score than he himself has 
        ◦ Lana says we should follow them because “we have to be within ten feet of him when he dies to resurrect Heather” Kaz loses her shit laughing, even as she tells Lana off for being so dark.
    • We don’t want to get caught up in the Undermountain and miss the full moon, so we decide to just hang out and have downtime. Kaz goes searching for ritual spells to add to her book of shadows. Nev leads services at the House of the Moon. Smutlana practices with Odo to become proficient with her net.
    • Two days into our downtime, at 11:42 on the 23rd of Eliasus, the world around Kaz suddenly goes black. She’s sucked into a vision of Exilicor, similar to the ones she sees during Contact Other Plane. Their message appears in her mind: “BAD BAD BAD DANGER.” 
    • Her vision clears, Exilicor’s glowing visage fading out and a blurry scene slowly clarifying in its place. Kaz sees a ten-pointed star and glowing golden thread, and realizes she’s looking out through the mythallar and up towards a ceiling of some sort. She can hear a percussive effect from above, as if something massive is trying to break into the chamber. Dust falls from the ceiling high above and vaporizes the instant it touches the mythallar. 
        ◦ Implies that Exilicor can look through Kaz as well, since she’s got a bit of their power. 
    • She’s sucked back to her vision of Exilicor and a thought appears: “Help?” 
    • Scared and confused, she responds “Aye, I’ll help ye, but how?” 
      Their messages continue – “Help! Bad! Ow!” – and Kaz grows more frantic. “How do I help!?” She gets the response “Near” followed by a frantic search of her mind as Exilicor tries to find the right words. “Things getting close, stop from finding. Help” The connection snaps, and the strain on Kaz’s mind drives her insane.
        ◦ This all went down while Kaz was on her own in the middle of a random store searching for new ritual spells
    • Kaz doesn’t come home that night. Nev casts Sending, gets the response “Death wretched addled else finally chant mind sea backgrounds.” Having seen Kaz go insane before, they know that it’s probably related to Kaz casting Contact Other Plane




Text RP
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
Sweaty and dripping in sweet, sweet honey, Smutlana and Odo return to House Moonstar in the evening.
“Oi! Nevaeh! Could you have the staff bring round the buckets? Odo licked off enough to make his tongue bleed - again - but obviously I’m still covered?”
Smutlana is just outside the back door or front door, whichever is accessible, and making a fuss and drawing stares
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/26/2022
(Nev's probably not home. She'll be the house of the moon until late.)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
(Oh fuck)
Eventually the servants come out and help.
By now it’s early evening after getting washed up. Nev is presumably doing temple stuff down the street
(@John Dungeon Master presumably we’d be weirded out that Kaz isn’t back yet? She should have been back by then no?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/26/2022
(Yeah, Kaz would usually be back for dinner)
John Dungeon Master — 09/26/2022
Yeah but maybe she’s just out late? Roll an insight check if you want to be sure
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
Using kenku recall
27
John Dungeon Master — 09/26/2022
You’re sure
However… just as you’re thinking something’s probably amiss, at about 6:30 pm Nevaeh returns to the house with insane Kaz in tow. She’s mostly spaced out, and occasionally randomly talking gibberish but she’s docile 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/26/2022
“The Watch found me at the Temple.” She goes to sit Kaz down by the fireplace. “We just saw her like this, but it's strange. She wouldn't have tried to contact Excilicor on her own, would she?”
“I don't think so.”
“I'll prepare her room. I think she will be able to just sleep this off?... Lana, can you keep an eye on her?”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
Uncharacteristically grim, Lana marches over to Kaz and tosses a fistful of diamond dust over where she’s sitting and draws a rainbow Enso into the air, casting Greater Restoration 
John Dungeon Master — 09/26/2022
Kaz snaps instantly out of insanity
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
Lana leans down on a knee and touches Kaz’s cheek with a hand to make eye contact
“Kaz, are you back?”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/26/2022
Kaz had been swaying from side to side and clutching her journal when Lana cast Greater Restoration. She blinks, rubbing the diamond dust out of her eyes, then suddenly shoots to her feet. "Wait, what? Where- How did I- What time is it? How long was I out?" 
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
Lana silently implores Nev for answers with grave, swelling eyes, feathers starting to puff up in alarm
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/26/2022
You hear what sounds like cabinets opening and closing, then you hear Nev say "Please get some water started." She comes into the room with some clean towels, robe and face cloths. thinking Kaz is still out of it "Here, lets get those shoes off. Why are they so muddy? I mean, really, really muddy. Where did you go Kaz?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/26/2022
She shakes her head, uncertain and still a bit out-of-sorts. "I- I don't know. The last I remember is searching for spell scrolls in a little shop I found near-" she cuts herself off with a wave of her hand, refocusing. "Is it still Eliasus 23rd?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/26/2022
With a small gasp, Nev says “Oh, sorry.” She looks to Lana "I didn't realize...look how sparkly you are right now!" She continues taking off the shoes anyways and sets them by the door. "Yes, it is. Was it still light outside last you remember?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/26/2022
She nods, absently casting Prestidigitation to clean off the mud she's tracked in. "Aye, around peak- I mean, noon. I think." She lowers her voice, not wanting the servants to overhear. "Exilicor contacted me. They're in trouble"
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
“Yes Nev, I used the diamond dust. Kind of a fabulous look, I kind of outdid myself not gonna lie,” Lana tilts his head once left and right in self-satisfaction while scrutinizing Kaz, “But we haven’t any time for that. Exilicor needs us! Kaz, what kind of trouble? You mean Exilicor reached out to you and not the other way around?!”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/26/2022
“Exilicor contacted you? What did they say exactly?”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/26/2022
"Aye, thank ye for snappin' me out o' that, Lana. I'll pay you back for the diamond dust." 
She turns to Nevaeh. "They showed me the mythallar that Nersiul and the others took with them when they fled. It's buried underground somewhere, probably in Carceri, and something is trying to break in and get to it. They begged me to help them keep it hidden." Kaz clutches her tome more tightly to her chest, voice softening. "It sounded like whatever was breaking in is hurting them"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/26/2022
“Oh, godess. So...is that where Exilicor is? If it's hurting them. I don't understand.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/26/2022
Kaz shakes her head. "I'm not sure. There's something of a communications barrier between us. They may be hurting, or they may be worried about being hurt, I can't be certain. But either way, something is getting very close to obtaining one of the most powerful magical artifacts in the planes." She looks around at the rest of the party, terrified 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/26/2022
“How do we get to this thing before they do? Or...stop them from getting to it?”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/26/2022
Kaz takes a moment to center herself, breathing in once and slowly letting it out. "...Asger. He was searchin' for it, remember? When we first met him, he asked Gilbert 'Where's the fucking mythallar?' If we find him, we'll find it"
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
“That settles it. We leave now.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/26/2022
Kaz nods once, looking gratefully around at the rest of the party. Her gaze softens as it lands on Odo. "I'm sorry to derail your quest, Odo. Perhaps we'll make it back in time for the full moon anyway? Lana, I think you mentioned a spell that would let us teleport through trees? We'd just need to pop back through that portal near Neverwinter and we could teleport right to the shrine."
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
“My spores have been tingling for days, you guys. It’s like someone cast Insect Plague in my little kenku panties. I’ll prepare the war horses.”
“Unless Nevaeh, do you have enough horses for us?”
(The assumption is that Smutlana would cast Conjure Animals to summon some riding horses to get us to the portal. Otherwise we have to walk which is too long. We could ride the summoned horses hard and then I would dismiss them when we arrived. With real horses we’d have to get them back somehow, it could be annoying)
(You know, like a war sporse)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
“If we leave now we can save the multiverse and be back in time for the quinceañbeara!!” Smutlana hops up from the kneel and attempts a heroic pose. I guess it’s more of a John Travolta disco type moment
John Dungeon Master — 09/26/2022
(If you’re trying to ride back to neverwinter, it would take a couple of weeks minimum)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
(Oh shit forgot we were in WD and portal in NW)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
“Yes, but I’m not powerful enough to cast that spell yet. I’m almost there but not quite”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/26/2022
Nev puts down the towels and robe. “I can try to see if Jaspar is awake and available to teleport us again? But, what's the plan, we go to Carceri and then what?”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/26/2022
“Honestly, I think we have to call in the big guns.”
“We know there’s a demon army there. We’ve defeated a demon army before, but that was with Holy Water Balloons of God”
“We need to tell Lady Renalia the full story and have her send in the cavalry. If ever there were a time to spend a bunch of money to buy the HWBGs, it’s now.”
“Separately, tell Ganth”
“Ganth could get us from here to Sigil immediately if we asked him to and were honest why”
“I think the best we could do is get there first and run interference and diversions  until the cavalry arrived”
“Unless… we ARE the cavalry…” Smutlana looks ponderingly at Kaz and the Rod of Drosys
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/27/2022
Kaz bites her lip. “…I’m concerned that if other people know about the mythallar, they’ll try to use it for themselves. Exilicor seemed to want it hidden, and if using it hurts them…” she trails off, letting her journal fall to her side. “Even if we can trust our allies not to use it themselves, word could get back to people like Lord Querial, and I will not allow that”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/27/2022
“Well it's either we face the forces of Asger or Zuggtmoy, or both, at the site of the mythellar in Carceri. Either way we're going to have to make the fight. The only question at this point is who we have with us.”
“If it can't be Lady Renalia, then who do we have other than Ganth? We could implore Selune and Psilofyr, but they're gods, they most likely won't directly intervene. I don't believe Psilofyr would. Maybe Selune? She seems like she'd be willing to break the rules if it was the right thing to do.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/27/2022
Kaz steels her resolve “Ganth wasn’t certain that the demons were there on Zuggtmoi’s behalf. And I think we can take on Asger alone. But aye, it would be prudent to know what we’re walkin’ into. Perhaps we can ask Selune if each is waitin’ for us?”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/27/2022
Smutlana entreaties Nevaeh by grasping both her elbows, one in each hand, and with grave desperation looks up “Daughter of the Moon, we beseech you! Call out to She Who Guides in this twilight hour!!”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
Nev stands up and wipes her hands. “Of course.” She walks to the alter in her living room and kneels down, washing her hands in the nearby basin.
Looking back to the party, she smiles 
“Our lady of Silver, I need your help now more than ever, before we step into the lower planes once again.”
"Is Asger at the mythallar now?"
(If yes,) "Is he alone?"
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
(Are you requesting divine intervention? Or communing? Or just praying?) 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
(Commune)
(One more Q based on the answers)
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
Ok so you get: unclear, unclear
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
(So she can't see that?)
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
(Seems like Selûne can’t see that)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
(I don't know if it's him or the mythallar that she can't see)
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
(Unfortunately yeah the response is somewhat limited)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
“Is he in Carceri?”
(Will be my final question then to determine if she can even see him)
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
Unclear
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
:oldangry:
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
(Sorry that was a bummer)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/27/2022
Seeing the lack of information from Selune, Lana springs into action
“Innovation is the spore child of desperation. Odo, some of those gnothic candles, light them. Nevaeh can you quickly prepare a prayer circle? Oh I don’t know the details, just make it cute and tidy. Kaz, help me arrange it all auspiciously.”
“We have no one to turn to but the Spore Lord. Let’s make a go of it. If we’re serious enough, Psilofyr will answer. I feel it in my spores.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
“Uh, alright, I can just…” She pulls some stuff from her Selune alter and some stuff from nearby drawers.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/27/2022
Kaz nods once, beginning to draw the planar symbol for Mechanus on the floor with her chalk. “I’ll clean this up after we’re done” she murmurs reassuringly to Nevaeh
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 09/28/2022
Odo helps light the gnothic candles
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/27/2022
“Yeah, just whatever you think would be nice. Maybe a piece of fruit as a humble offering, We’ll place it in our scrying shell.”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/27/2022So with the hasty preparations made, Smutlana kneels in the  center of Kaz’s planar symbol, puts a pear in the scrying shell and places it in the central dot of the Mechanus symbol and begins reciting a druidic koan for a sign
(Looks like that iirc)
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
(Yep)
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
As the minutes tick by with nothing happening, you begin to think back to your visit to Mycelia when Psilofyr impressed upon you that you would have to seek your destiny under your own power if you were to avoid ruin and defeat. Perhaps you just happened to think of that, or perhaps Psilofyr made you think it and that was its answer. No way to know. 
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/27/2022
Kaz sighs. “…that shator Angina mentioned. Gersh. He’d know where Asger went. And he’s powerful enough I could Contact him” 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
(Well, Nev can't do it on her own, she needs Selune. 🙃)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/27/2022
Smutlana chuckles and starts blowing out the candles ceremoniously one by one
“Hey Nev, Psilofyr said he hates your fucking pears.”
“Just kidding. There wasn’t a direct response.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
Nev eats the pear.
John Dungeon Master — 09/27/2022
You think back to your mother telling you that the Moon Maiden helps those who help themselves
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/27/2022
"I don't know if we have the time to rest, but I need it."
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/27/2022
Smutlana gives Nev a long, silent, rocking hug, suppressing the urge to cry and replacing it with humor “Thank you for the shitty pear tho.”
“Alright, well that’s all Nev and I got. We can reach out to Ganth I guess, or just go it alone in the morning.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/27/2022
Kaz hugs them both, placing her journal on a side table. “We can’t go in half-awake. Not against Asger, and especially not to the lower planes. We’ll make time to rest”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/27/2022
“Maybe reach out to Uncle Jasper for a portal back to Neverwinter. I’m down for whatever you want. We should make the plan and do our last communications now, then follow through in the morning on a full rest.”
“If we got back to Neverwinter now, then we could make our way back to the portal and be in Sigil with enough time to get a full night of sleep.”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 09/27/2022
Odo looks over at Kaz
"Uh, I be a bit of nerves, reckon, you did done have an incident before we hit the hay not that long ago where... ya know. I figure it be a mighty tiring for ya to maintain that there communication you do all fancy like with them other worldly things"
He nods to himself.
"Done be mighty glad Kaz that ya didn't end up more mushy then them mush cakes that Lana makes - I done be astounded that Lana and Nev got the fancy shiney dust that done be makin you feel better"
Odo thinks
"Uhhhhh Exilicor be needin' us? but ah, Exilicor not be threatening us right?"
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 09/28/2022
He chuckles
"Reckon that aye, there be a lotta moooons, but I done be feelin' more mighty a comfy if we can try to keep your noggin in one piece and keep uh Exclicor a mighty a safe"
Odo thinks, gears slowly turn
"Uh ay a Kaz, you reckon, is uh, Tinkerreach with them uh, elemental guards she done have safe, sheeeeda' let us know if something went might upside-down, right?"
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
(Are you planning to sleep in WD?)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/28/2022
(I'm going to send to Jasper to find out I think)
Casting sending Jasper, “A huge event has happened and we quickly need to get to Carceri From Sigil. Can you teleport us to Neverwinter in the morning?”
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
He says: “oh! Alright if it’s an emergency. Will you be at the roost? I can meet you there in the morning” 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/28/2022
"Yes, it is, thank you so much. We can explain briefly tomorrow at the roost at dawn"
(so yeah, well sleep at Nev's place)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
(So, then, how will you get to the falcons roost at dawn? It’s 40 miles away.)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/28/2022
40 minutes after dawn?
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
(But so, you’re at your house in Waterdeep and you need to be at the falcons roost which is a 40 mile journey north to east Amphail. You rode horses from there to the city and it took a whole day. So how do you plan to get there at dawn if you now sleep in the city?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
(or we could tell him that we're in Waterdeep)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
(He uses a teleportation circle at the falconsroost which is why you had to go there in the first place instead of directly to the city) 
(Kaz would know that teleportation without a circle is a much more difficult form of magic that he might not have access to)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
Kaz glances over at Nevaeh. "Dawn? We'd have to ride through the night to make it to Falcon's Roost by dawn. Let's set out at dawn instead and contact Jasper when we arrive"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/28/2022
Okay. Nev will send again and correct herself according to what Kaz says.
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
(I guess Nev would have known the travel time involved and would have said that differently the first time but maybe you were thinking the group would leave now and ride through the night)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/28/2022
(I did not remember it was that far away.)
(As me, yeah.)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
(You guys are going to really appreciate travel spells when you get them lol)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
(god I'm so ready)
(I've been waiting to get Planeshift since I created Kaz)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
Any thing else to do before you sleep?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
(Yes, but I’m in class rn)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
Oh
My condolences
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/28/2022
(I can at least  get us mounts in morning so we don’t have to pay)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
You rode horses from the roost down to the city 
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/28/2022
(Conjure animals is prepped)
(I can conjure 4 warhorses right?)
(Oh you mean we have the horses)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
Yes
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/28/2022
(Gotcha)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
(Okay, I’m back and finished with dinner!)
Kaz moves off to the side so she won’t distract Nevaeh and casts her own Sending spell. “Ganth. Do you know of any portals to Waterdeep?”
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
“I sorry, I don’t know where this Water Deep is much less how to get there.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
She sighs, then shrugs. “Worth a shot, I suppose”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
(Before Kaz goes to bed, she wants to cast Contact Other Plane again. Privately, because if she goes insane this time, she doesn't want to worry anyone)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
Ok
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/28/2022
(!!)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
Safely in her room, Kaz casts Intellect Fortress before beginning the Contact Other Plane ritual
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
Ok
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
(19 saves!)
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
Yep
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
With a gasp, Kaz's vision tunnels. Connection made, she asks her first question: "Is more than one person digging towards the mythallar?"
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
You feel it searching your mind to understand the concept of digging.
Unclear
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
Kaz nods, having expected the response, but still a little disappointed. "Will the diggers reach the mythallar within a day?"
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
Unclear
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
She bites her lip. "Are you trapped inside the mythallar?"
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
No
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
"Do you want me to find a way to sever your connection to the mythallar?"
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
Yes
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
"Would destroying the conduit sever your connection to the mythallar?"
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
No
The spell ends
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
Kaz takes a long, deep breath and lets it out slowly. "Alright then. Tall order." She cleans the ritual chalk lines off the floor with a wave of her hand and a bit of Prestidigitation. "Eat a dragon one bite at a time, I suppose"
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
So you all wake up pre dawn on the 24th of Eleasis.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
Kaz enters the common room already packed and looking anxious. She's unusually quiet as she fiddles with a fraying bookmark poking out of her journal.
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/28/2022
Packed but unarmored, Smutlana finishes assembling a breakfast plate for Kaz and pours a cup of hot tea, handing them over briskly with a quick but kind smile. “While it’s still hot, Kaz.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
Kaz takes both with a grateful smile in return. "Thanks, Lana."
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/28/2022
“You’re welcome! Gonna need those wiggle fingers nice and wiggly for what’s about to pop off in Carceri.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/28/2022
She chuckles, giving her fingers a playful wiggle. "We'll need your spores as well."
John Dungeon Master — 09/28/2022
(So does the party ride back to the falcons roost?)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/28/2022
Nev needs to stop by the house of the moon on her way out to give Khim a goodbye hug, and pass her something before she leaves. She's gonna give Tammy a thumbs up if she's there as well. Saying one last prayer before heading back to the stables/party to head out.
John Dungeon Master — 09/29/2022
(pass her something?)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/29/2022
(roll an insight check 🤫)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/29/2022
Dirty 20
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/29/2022
(11)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/29/2022
(lol that was aimed at the DM, I think that's probably perception though) (If you guys went to the temple with me and went inside then I guess you could probably roll something if you were watching me haha)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/29/2022
(If we’re there present I think you need to roll sleight hand against our <something>)
(Prolly perception)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/29/2022
(did you all come, cuz I was just stopping by on our way out)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/29/2022
(Kaz probably waited outside, if Nev was just stopping in quickly)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/29/2022
(Same)
(Maybe under dm discretion lana insight could be to understand why nev wanted to go to temple first)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/29/2022
"I need to stop by the temple on the way out, to say goodbye to Khim and pray to the Moon Maiden one last time while I'm home. You guys are welcome to come in, it'll probably be pretty quiet this early. Otherwise, I'll just be a moment.” (is what she would have said)
John Dungeon Master — 09/29/2022
So this all depends on the situation, is Nev having the party go in with her to witness this?
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/29/2022
(They can go in if they want to but she's not bringing them in to see it, it's just something she's doing while in there)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/29/2022
(Smutlana would go in just out of caution)
John Dungeon Master — 09/29/2022
Ok so then you all leave and ride to the falcon’s roost, correct?
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/29/2022
(SmutlAna didn’t see anything exchanged?)
John Dungeon Master — 09/29/2022
(Was Nev trying to hide that? It would be very easy for her to say wait here a minute and be alone with her friend if she wanted but she may not care one way or another)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/29/2022
(I'll roll a slight of hand against that perception check from earlier if needed)
John Dungeon Master — 09/29/2022
(if you were making no effort be alone but then tried to surreptitiously pass something with out Smutlana seeing then you would roll slight of hand. If you made an effort to be alone with Khim or openly passed the thing in front of Smutlana then there is no need to roll) 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/29/2022
(I guess Lana saw)
John Dungeon Master — 09/29/2022
(Yep)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/29/2022
(What was it??)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/29/2022
(Some envelopes.)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 8:17 PM
(So without incident you reach the falcon’s roost on the night of the 24th and Jasper is there waiting. I assume you want to head back to neverwinter now?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/29/2022
(yep!)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 10/03/2022
On the ride back to Falcon's Roost Kaz turns to Nevaeh and Odo. "So, what sort of adventures did your parents go on? I know they fought the Shadovar, but not much else."
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 10/03/2022
Odo thinks for a while 
"Reckon there were artifacts found, done figure at least from all them Shar and Shadovar things they did done find some artifacts here and there. Pa's study... reckon it had a lotta notes ‘bout things.  Maybe it done been like recording information ‘bout things that was found rather than just keeping them things that done be found"
Odo thinks harder eyes gazed up towards his forehead as if maybe a better thought would come to him
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 10/04/2022
“It was fighting the Shadovar, and finding relics to keep them out of their hands, mostly. But I do remember one story about their excursion into the tomb of an ancient Netherese arch mage?” She peeks over at Kaz at the mention of a Netherese arch mage as she joyfully continues “Tomb Raiding stories were my favorite.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 10/05/2022
“So, there was an old, dying Bedine priest of Selune that saw my mom in her clerical vestments, made a connection with her, and entrusted her with this big secret. The secret to finding a Netherese arch mage scroll which had been long foretold by the Bedine people.”
Unsure if anybody is familiar with the Bedine, she quickly looks around “The Bedine were desert folk, ya know, not a lot of them out this way really. They worshipped variations of Netherese gods, one of which was Elah - Selune as we know her - and were generally badasses.”
“Anyway, the scroll location that he was entrusting to my mom was in the desert near his homelands, in the tomb of an ancient Arch Mage. Something so powerful in the wrong hands could have been...really bad for Faerun. So, with that info her, my dad, Uncle Othar and Jasper all set out to find this arch mages' scroll, as they'd gotten word that Zachulnur was also actively looking for it. Zachulnur was a Paladin of Shar, a General for the Shadovar and kind of a big deal - but in a bad way.”
“So, the four of them set out to the desert, and using various signs from the heavens - that would ultimately lead to finding the tomb - they were able to ambush groups of Shadovar also looking for the same signs (and tomb). Eventually, they found the location of the tomb but Zachulnur was already there, so they stealthily followed his elite team into the tomb.”
“They were totally outnumbered, but had the element of surprise, and also my dad, the agent of chaos.” She chuckles to herself. “Othar and Jasper thought it would be best to retreat and alert the Kingdom of Cormyr but my dad saw on the way in that there was a collapsing walkway trap that had been disabled by Zachulnur and his men so they could enter safely.”
“So...they simply waited for the Shadovar to start to leave the tomb and dad triggered the trap from the other side. It very quickly caused the entire tomb entrance to collapse! Burying Zachulnur and his whole team inside, along with whatever they may have been bringing out with them. Scrolls, relics, gold...who knows.” Nev's face feels cold while they trot along the path, she rubs it and realizes she has some dried tears chilling her face.
“Mmmm...I guess mom heard sometime later that the original scroll had been removed many years earlier by agents of the Harpers and replaced with a fake, so maybe Zachulnur was leaving with a fake, or maybe he never found it. Either way, they're dead, and the Shadovar took a hit when they lost such a high ranking member of their army and his elite troop. And the scroll is safe with The Harpers.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 10/05/2022
Kaz looks excited at the mention of Netherese ruins and adventure. She’s riveted as Nevaeh speaks, only noticing her tears at the very end. She leans over and gently pats Nev’s shoulder. “Sounds like quite the adventure. It’s a good thing we’ll have similarly exciting tales to tell your da when we find him”
John Dungeon Master — 10/05/2022
(Kaz has likely heard of the nether scrolls, the ancient source of power of the netherese empire.)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 10/05/2022
"I miss those stories. We had everything together and I know she was happy then and now. But sometimes I miss being able to hear her tell me a story at night. That's all."
“We really will have some great stories too. She smiles at Kaz “I mean, we already do. We have a home in the city of doors! Haha”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 10/05/2022
Kaz laughs. "Aye, we do"
Her expression softens. "When my ma died, Da and I planted a tree in her honor near our home. Even though she wasn't with us anymore, it helped me feel like she was still close." She shrugs, a bit awkward. "I know there's not really... soil or anythin' in Sigil, but perhaps plantin' something small in a pot on your windowsill would keep your ma close as well?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 10/06/2022
“I like that idea. ...Maybe not a mushroom though.”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Today at 4:14 PM
Jocularly, but more solemn than usual, Smutlana conjectures: “Well let’s see, what do mushrooms represent? When something dies, the mushroom converts the death into an opportunity for new life. Through decay, the dead re-enter the Circle of Life. Mushrooms represent circularity, repetition, continuity, and renewal. Praise the spores!” Lana excitedly draws the Enso into the air with Druidcraft
“There’s very much a sense now, with your mother passed and you alive carrying on her adventuring legacy investigating the goings on of the ancient Netherese, and doing so wielding the power of the Moon, of an unmistakable continuity.
As you give new life to her old adventures, you recycle the memories and stories and make them your own. What could be more poetic to express that than with a mushroom? I can probably find you some that don’t stink too bad.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 4:53 PM
Kaz smiles, glancing at Nev's expression. "Well said, Lana. But while a mushroom would certainly be fitting, I doubt it would grow too well on a windowsill. Did your ma had a favorite flower?"
