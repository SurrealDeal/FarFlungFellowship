    • We kill a couple githzerai at the base of the stairs and follow the remainder up the stairs to the domed chamber with water constantly flowing in a circle and four bridges leading over the water to the gnarled tree
        ◦ On the opposite side of the the tree is one githzerai (the Anarch, Almecha) being attacked by four githyanki. As they fight, sand is dribbling down the walls and onto our heads.
        ◦ One of the githyanki is clearly a caster (a gish). Kaz immediately hexes her, tries to blast her and misses, and gets a glare in return
    • Zug, Basil, Heather, Odo, githzerai, githyanki, Nevaeh, Kaz
    • strange craft like a ship with ribbed, fish-fin-like scales that appears to have crash-landed into one of the trees . a larger version is fleeing, then disappears in a silver flash
        ◦ we learn that these are Astral Skiffs, and that the githyanki use them to travel their home plane and to occasionally raid other planes
        ◦ Kaz investigates the small boat, finds a pedestal with a globe with energy streams inside (probably used to steer the ship)
    • LaShella: “you fought well, I saw. thank you, all of you” She lets us know the overseer has just arrived and will see us later in the day. She suspects that the githyanki knew when the Overseer would arrive and targeted them to try to kidnap him
    • We reconvene in the audience chamber with Anarch almecha, dronear the prior, serach the overseer. They offer to either take us to the Outlands (where Sigil is located) or to give us the downed astral skiff to reach the Astral Plane
        ◦ Plane of Concordant Opposition (“The Outlands”) – more likely to be a portal to Sigil there
        ◦ Astral Plane – has color pools leading to outer planes, including the Outlands
    • We choose to take the astral skiff. Serach gives us each a bracelet of jade beads that will mark us as friends of the githzerai. He bids us goodbye with the phrase “Endure. And in enduring, become stronger.”
    • We say goodbye to LaShella and the various other githzerai we know, waving as we board the skiff. Nevaeh plays a song on her flute as we go.
    • We shift into the Astral Plane. It’s pearlescent, with subtly different colors of mist all around us. Wisps of silver cloud and motes of light drift in the far distance. We can’t really feel ourselves breathing in air, even as we take breaths. Nevaeh holds her breath, but never feels the urge to breath. We don’t smell anything.
        ◦ eventually, we realize that we can will ourselves into the air and float
    • Looking through the sextant, Kaz can see a gold color pool (mt celestia), ruby (nine hells), and olive (carceri).
    • We travel on and pass pools to arborea (sapphire), two portals to the prime material (silver), and the twin realms of bytopia (amber)
        ◦ Prime Material portals may not lead to our planet
    • Nevaeh casts Divination to ask what plane her father is located on, but receives the answer that Selune can’t see him. Zug casts Divination to ask Psilofyrr the safest route to the nearest Vigilant Sentinel, finds out that the Plane of Concordant Opposition (leather brown)
        ◦ Zug also gets Odo to rub some of his spell-casting incense under his sweaty pits
        ◦ Nevaeh and Kaz work together to force Odo to take a bath
    • We travel further, and see a magenta pool. Kaz can’t quite translate the word for magenta, but figures out it probably lead to Pandemonium. We travel for days, passing portals to Limbo (jet black), the Ethereal Plane (spiralling white, pretty rare), Peacable Realms of Arcadia (flame red), Acaron (saffron), Gehenna (russet)
    • Kaz sees something following us in the distance. We can just discern that it seems to be alive. As it gets closer, we can see that it has tentacles, a toothy maw, and crab claws.
    • Desperately, the Far Flung Fellowship continues to search for a leather brown portal. As the creature closes in, we pass Isgard (indigo), Elysium (orange), Hades (rust), and FINALLY spy a portal to the Plane of Concordant Opposition.
        ◦ the portal looks like a perfect 20ft diameter circle from every angle
    • With Kaz piloting and Odo and Zug drawing out the skiff’s fins, we’re able to just barely outrun the creature and dive full speed ahead into the leather brown portal. We just have time to register a sunny blue sky before we crash right into the ground. The ship is utterly destroyed, but we manage to survive the fall with only cuts and bruises
    • We see settlement smoke over a hill and decide to investigate. We find a small worn path after a bit of walking, and follow it until we hear the sounds of clockwork. Zug wildshapes into an owl, flies over the hill, and sees a troop of about 20 modrons (clockwork creatures from Mechanus)
    • The modrons are surrounding a humanoid figure. The humanoid points at the modrons and blasts them apart, but the modrons continue onward, unphased. Zug returns to the group to report, then flies back up to spy. The humanoid figure destroys the rest of the modrons, spies Zug, and comes to interrogate us.
        ◦ Zug tells it we’re trying to get to Sigil. It asks what Nevaeh is, she tells it she’s an aasimar, it warns her that “this place is not for you” and flies off
    • We continue to follow the smoke until we see an old human man sitting on a rock. He tells us there’s probably a portal to Sigil in the town up ahead, Toravera. He says that he likes to live off the land, but that caravans sometimes pass through the town. He also clocks us as from another plane when we ask about the flying creature, explains that it’s a reilmani.
    • Another guy walks up and tries to rob Odo. Zug catches him, and he runs off. Zug, Odo, and Kaz immediately chase after him, sap his strength, blind him with magic and briefly banish him to a pocket dimension. He’s absolutely terrified by the end of it, 
        ◦ Meanwhile, Nevaeh hangs out with the old man (who just calls himself “old man”)
        ◦ Kaz realizes that these people are probably Petitioners, people who died on the prime material and came to the Outlands as their afterlife. We’d expect such varied behavior from them
    • We reach the city, which is carved into the top of a red-violet sandstone plateau. Beneath the plateau are caravan tents. Nevaeh skips into the city. All manner of strange people and races are lined up before the gate waiting to get into the city. A man in a purple robe with blond shoulder length hair, pointed ears, and stubby green horns mans the gate. We pay the 2gp toll and enter the city.
    • Entering the city, we see halfling-like creatures with red or white horns are the most common race (they look like halfling tieflings; plane-touched halflings), though there are also a huge variety of other races, including some that even Kaz hasn’t seen before
    • We head to a tavern for information. Kaz buys a round of ale to soften up the waiter, learns that there’s a portal to Sigil in the town’s central tower, and that there’s a fee to use it based on what you’re trying to bring through.
    • We spend the night, pay an exorbitant fee to pass through the portal, and finally arrive in Sigil

Errata
    • Odo keeps calling the githyanki lich queen “the lunch queen” in gith, since he can’t quite pronounce the gith word for “lich”
    • Kaz has finished reading all her planar books, which gives her advantage on any checks involving information found in the books (Like using the Realm of Substance and Thought book to identify which planes different Color Pools lead to)

Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 11:43 AM
It’s evening time at the little inn where the Far Flung Fellowship is staying, as they prepare to cross through the doorway into Sigil. Kaz looks up from her dinner plate at the rest of the party. “Y’know, if we’re gettin’ into the adventurin’ business, we ought to have a way for people to recognize us. I’ve seen a few mercenary companies that favor a particular color - gods know the bloody Zhentarim are always wearing black. What if we had our own color, like purple?”
Zuggtboy "Zug" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 11:47 AM
zug, who was busy quasi-melding, snaps out of his trance Oh my spores Kaz I love it. Purple spores are some of my favorites, and plus that color looks ameeeeeezing in dim moonlight, dontcha think Nevaeh?
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 12:45 PM
Agreed. It's royal too 😊
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 12:53 PM
Kaz flicks her cloak outward, and purple ripples over the fabric. “We’ll find you some purple glamorweave, Nev, and then we can match”
Zuggtboy "Zug" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 1:07 PM
zug’s eyes glimmer in excitement as he too flicks his cloak outward with flair… he pauses, hand outreached… and nothing happens 
“kuuuuuuuu…” zug laments dejectedly, crumpling back into his seat.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 1:19 PM
That would be amazing!
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 3:00 AM
Odo still picking out hay from under his armor having spent a night in the stables, shuffles around looking towards Kaz and the rest of the party 
"Mighty right, done figure that then there mercenaries tendin be to havin a color that all who done cross paths withum can recognize"
"A purple could work well" Odo nodding
