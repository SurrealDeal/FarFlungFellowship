    • (we’ve had several portrait sittings by now, and now it just needs to be painted)
    • We’re disarmed and the Formians lead us back down the tunnel. We come to the tunnel with the winch & pulley, and see the druid Rua’s body at the bottom of the shaft, as if she were pushed over the edge above. We’re pulled up to the tunnel above, where we see the unconscious golden dragonborn Vertin.
        ◦ Kaz and Odo try to comfort the distraught Chiprick and his party, while Lana and Nev deduce that she has slashing wounds from a fight prior to her death and that its unlikely that the Formians killed her. We also learn that she’s Lucy’s sister
        ◦ Kaz learns that “your highness” is the proper way to address the queen in Common
    • We’re led to a room with a central circular platform. On it is a very large Formian with atrophied legs, surrounded by murmarks half her size. The planetar is behind her, contained in a glowing cage. Other auction participants have also been arrested and brought to the chamber, including members of the Order of the Planes Militant and the celestial advisor who told the PM woman to “purify the Harmonium with fire”
    • The queen speaks to the room. “In my centuries of rule, never has such a breach of the peace happened in Altrick. All of you, purported to be servants of good, how could this have happened? Particularly you!” she looks at the planetar “How could such a being do such things??”
        ◦ Planetar: “I do what must be done” (this pisses Odo off)
        ◦ The other celestial accuses the planetar of being a traitor, starts a shouting match with him, breaks free of his captors and flies at the planetar, stabs him through the chest and kills him in a burst of light. we watch the fighting in shock
    • We’re all banished from the city for fighting, the strictest punishment the Formians give out. We’re escorted to the city gate, not to our portal to Sigil, and given our stuff back. Just outside the gate are a whole contingent of Harmonium, waiting to apprehend us and the other “thieves” exporting crystals.
    • Cpt Cloudsilver, Warren Foeslayer, and Fimerith appear. Fimerith casts a spell and a portal appears before us, which he ushers us into.
    • Lana casts Erupting Earth to slow down the Harmonium. Kaz summons an aberrant spirit (a beholderkin, so it can float above the erupted earth) to intimidate and slow down the Harmonium before running through the portal as well. The Guardians and the Far Flung Fellowship dart through the portal, followed by the spelljammer crew.
        ◦ The beholderkin still exists even when Kaz moves out of range, but it can only obey her verbal commands.
    • We find ourselves about 500 ft away, beside a small hovering jolleyboat. There’s a female mage in a trancelike state in the boat operating the spelljammer helm, and we all quickly hop on. The mage takes us away into the air, far from the fight. The Harmonium scream out in rage as we get away and demand that their compatriots follow us.
        ◦ Mrs Laura Montbarrik is the helmswoman
    • We stop to catch our breath for a moment and express our gratitude for the rescue. As we do, we see two draconelles in the distance, ridden by two figures. Cpt Cloudsilver says he doesn’t think they’re friendly, so we prepare to fight.
    • Kaz casts Mental Prison on one of the dragonelles. It suffers the initial 5d10 psychic damage, gets restrained, falls out of the illusion, and dies to another 10d10 psychic damage. It’s rider falls to the ground screaming, still seated on its corpse.
        ◦ the other rider dives after their friend, and we’re out of combat
    • Looking down, everything is laid out in a grid pattern. Once we get high enough, we can see that the entire planar landscape is completely orderly. It’s a little spooky and weird to the more chaotic party members, but the lawful good Kaz thinks that it reminds her of planted fields. In the far distance is an orb we think must be the sun, but it’s just sitting near the horizon.
    • We fly through a color pool into the Astral Sea. Cpt Cloudsilver thanks Nev for loaning him the geyser-pitcher to put out fires during the battle, handing it to her with a flourish.
    • Cpt Cloudsilver explains that Lady Renalia sent him to pick us up. Though she’d initially sent us to negotiate for the benignitite, she’d later confirmed that Urefius was captured by the Harmonium (or at least by people they’d hired) and she’d decided to bring the party back in.
        ◦ The Guardians also introduce themselves to the Moonbeam’s crew
    • Kaz chit-chats with the Guardians as they travel, and learns they’re from Elysium. Vertin says that the specific project they want the benignitite for is only known to their higher ups (and also notices that the fake employer name Kaz gives him and the auction is a lie, but doesn’t call her out on it). 
        ◦ We ask (in a roundabout way) if the Guardians have ever seen any bewitched celestials. Chiprick says that it’s always possible that two good people have different ideas about what’s good.
    • Lucy asks Nev if she has the power to bring people back from the dead. Nev gladly agrees to do so once she’s had the opportunity to sleep and prepare Raise Dead, but Lucy says that there are other clerics in Elysium who can do it, and she doesn’t want to make us wait to go home.
    • We fly through another color pool and into Elysium. It’s a pristine land of fluffy white clouds and blue skies, with golden fields below and a shining river meandering across the landscape. Happy people wave to us as we land and let the Guardians off.
    • We fly back through the Astral Sea and to the docking asteroid. We see the Rainbow Wing and the Moonbeam in drydock, undergoing repairs. We head back to Sigil, where Lady Renalia is awake and interested in meeting with us despite the lateness of the hour. We explain the madness at the auction, and Lady Renalia exclaims that it’s very out-of-character for the Harmonium to interfere in a neutral city. She also says that she has our anti-demon weaponry as a reward, but we agree to pick it up the following morning so we won’t keep her up.
    • Cpt Cloudsilver decides to stay the night in the city. Nev lets the rest of the party head home before her so she can thank him for saving the party and so she can ask him out to breakfast the next morning, which he agrees to. 
        ◦ she’s still got a massive crush on him :D
    • We get a long rest. Nevaeh rushes down the stairs when she hears Cpt Cloudsilver the next morning, trying to look cool and definitely failing as she stumbles forward. They sit down to Eudora’s breakfast and chat.
        ◦ He was born in Truelight, antispire of the gate town of Ecstasy. It’s an ascetic community of aasimar, where people mainly work, pray, and prepare for the afterlife in Elysium. His whole family is aasimar, his parents were strict, and his childhood wasn’t particularly joyful. Eventually, he wanted to see what was outside the village and he left. He unknowingly fell in with a pirate vessel and spent many formative years travelling through the Astral Sea until he decided his values didn’t align with theirs and split. He got educated in Sigil, where he met Lady Renalia.
            ▪ Most of the community has children with each other, but occasionally a new person joins the community. It’s quite rare, across the planes, for a child to be born directly from a celestial.
        ◦ Nev explains her family and childhood, including how she’s looking for her dad
        ◦ Kaz wakes up a little later, comes downstairs, and overhears Nev on her date. She uses magic to teleport into the kitchen, grab some food, and teleport back to her room without interrupting. Odo and Lana sleep in very late and don’t wake up for breakfast.
    • Kaz comes downstairs once she hears the captain leave, grins, and asks “So how’d it go?” Nev immediately and excitedly catches her up on everything. Odo finally wakes up and decides to prank scare Willow (Lana’s awakened bluecap).
    • We make our way to Lady Renalia’s estate to pick up our gifts. Lady Renalia is there to greet us, and says we all did splendidly. The benignitite we secured will hopefully entice the demons to go after their ancestral enemies, the devils, rather than attacking the Prime Material as rumors have hinted. She also has news: the war with Lolth is over, and she’s heard confirmed reports that the demon web pits have been fully occupied by other forces. Hopefully she stays gone for centuries and Lady Renalia’s people will have the chance to be free from her horrible influence.
        ◦ For Lana: a suit of magical studded leather armor which allows the user to change its appearance at will.
        ◦ For Kaz: a ring that goes over two fingers. It’s a ring of spell-storing, which accepts magic spells to be cast later.
        ◦ For Nev: a silver mace called a Moon’s Hand, clearly from Faerun (and something Lady Renalia clearly went to great effort to get). Used by paladins of Selune, particularly effective against fiends and undead
        ◦ For Odo: a fairly austere longsword. Once attuned, it can transform into a ring on his sword hand (no matter where the sword itself is). It’s also a +1 longsword.
    • We thank Lady Renalia for her generosity and she reminds us that we’ll see her at Priestess Asara’s wedding, which the lady is hosting on her estate.

I forgot to mention that back on 2 Eleint, Kaz got a sending message from Tinkerreach saying that a suspicious person had shown up at her studio, claiming to be a friend of Kaz and asking questions. She immediately teleported to a safe place, and when she came back, her studio had been searched. She said she is going on sabbatical for a while to another plane.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 12/24/2022 4:11 PM
Kaz would be apologetic, and ask what the person looked like
(Also, what day is it now?)
John Dungeon Master — 12/24/2022 4:11 PM
It is now 29 Eleint
She told you the person was disguised as a woman but she discreetly cast a true seeing spell and saw that it was in fact a man in an arcane robe with slicked back black hair and pallid skin
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 12/24/2022 4:20 PM
Kaz would warn her that it sounded like Asger, and be glad she was safe on another plane
