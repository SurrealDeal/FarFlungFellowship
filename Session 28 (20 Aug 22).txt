Session Notes
    • It’s Eliasus 9
    • hot take: Kaz’s crystal pendant is a shard of the Crystal Sphere
    • Also, I think (and have been thinking for a while, but Lady Rhydell’s identity really lends it weight) that Rezoradrath and Mordelon are the same motherfucker.
    • Branaris called himself “Gale of the West.” Othar thought he was human, until years later when he found out Branaris was an eladrin from Nevaeh’s mom
    • Kaz makes a Sending connection with Odo’s mother Abigail. Othar seems uncomfortable with the idea of doing the staring ritual and calls her over. Bruh.
    • Lana suggests that Odo distract his father while she and Kaz sneak back into his study and fix the floor with Stone Shape. Kaz recalls that the animated armor didn’t look too messed up after the battle, and that Othar wouldn’t expect them to come to life when he (an authorized entrant) entered the secret basement, so she relates that the armor should be fine.
    • We visit the temple to Selune in Waterdeep (the Church of the Moon and Stars), to appease Othar and try to convince Odo’s sister Tammy not to be a paladin of Selune. Nevaeh gives us a tour of the public areas
        ◦ The main room has a permanent illusion of the moon and stars, and priestesses are surrounded by the illusion of silver fire as they walk through. On the altar is the “Wand of the Four Moons”, the mace that Selune used to defeat Shar. It’s presented as the real one, which fell to the ground after the battle, but Nevaeh knows it’s just a replica.
    • We meet Nevaeh’s friend Khimesse on the tour. She and Nevaeh are excited to see each other and instantly start catching up. Nev introduces her as “Khim.” She’s a silver dragonborn.
    • We head upstairs to where the trainees are training with wooden staffs. Odo and Tammy catch up excitedly, and Odo defies his father’s wishes to support Tammy’s quest to become a paladin. Nevaeh recalls that most of the Falcanspur girls just marry into other noble families.
        ◦ Tammy reveals that Brigida and Xanthos stayed behind to fight the dragon and give the other refugees time to escape.
        ◦ Lana plays devil’s advocate and tries to halfheartedly convince Tammy not to be a paladin.
        ◦ Nevaeh gives Tammy the real rundown on everything we’ve faced (including how she’d died), with Kaz adding minor illusions to help explain. Tammy is shocked, but seems even more devoted to Selune and the fight against evil by the end of the conversation.
    • On our way out, we pass Gesilia Reddenthorp (nee Moonstar), human Priestess of High Moonlight (often said to be highest ranking priestess of Selune in Faerun). She wears fine robes and waves to Nev as we pass. One of her attendants is a werecat (good lycanthropes often align with Selune)
    • Nevaeh stays behind to chat with Khimesse in the temple while the rest of the party walks next door to Gonar’s Tavern to “pour one out” for Brigida and Xanthos.
        ◦ “Is it more or less appropriate to celebrate a person’s life in a place called ‘Gonner’s Tavern’?” - Kaz
    • Odo decides that he wants to confront his father about his family’s past when they return to Falcon’s Roost, and also to search Loop Woods for the bear totem he saw in his dream.
    • We return to Odo’s family home. Odo claims that he tried to dissuade Tammy but she remained unswayed. He reminds his father that Tammy is strong and that she can make her own decisions, and encourages his father to support those decisions. His father can tell immediately that Odo didn’t really try to deter Tammy, and is not convinced to let her keep training as a paladin.
    • Othar tells about what happened when Rezoradrath tracked down the mining town refugees. Families scattered to the woods. Lady Thealana Rhydell turned out to be a silver dragon herself (Nevaeh recalls that silver dragons breathe cold, which could explain the icy blast from “assassins”). She transformed and flew Brigida, Xanthos, and a few others up to fight Rezzoradrath. Only Sir Gondrian survived, badly burned. All the families survived.
    • Kaz takes a look at Laurie’s mystery book. Kaz can see it’s geneaological trees with notations, with notes about “Ursina this” and “Ursina that”. Earlier pages have interview notes with people and notes from other geneaology books. It appears to be years worth of investigations into Ursina family history. The books loo
        ◦ There are also notes on another family. Odo recognizes his mother’s maiden name.
        ◦ It looks like Othar was looking around to find all possible descendents of earlier generations of the Ursina family. He found Abigail that way (she and her ancient relative would’ve been like 9th or 10th cousins, no more related than any two strangers).
            ▪ Jotted in the page where he made that connection is “Break the curse?” The note on the page is dated 1467 DR.
    • Odo asks his mom about the rumors his family wasn’t legitimately descended from the Ursinas and how he’d heard he was “secondborn”, and she blanches and makes an excuse to leave the room. She locks herself in her bedchamber, but comes out to hug Odo goodbye.
        ◦ As he hugs her, he says “Ma, you know I love you regardless of what I hear about this family. I don’t care about things being real or not real, or even me having a brother I never knew about.” 
        ◦ His mother stiffens. “Um, uh, ask your father!” 
        ◦ Kaz, mind-reading around the corner at Odo’s bequest, senses fear and dismay that Odo has found out something he wasn’t supposed to know, something his mother thought was secret. She’s extremely anxious about the source of this information in the world, and how anyone could have acquired it.
    • We take off for Falcon’s Roost with Odo’s father and a few servants, spending a night at an inn along the road. We take off early in the morning, before Othar leaves, to meet a half-orc friend of Odo’s named Sear’Rebellion.
        ◦ He’s been working as a ranger for Odo’s family since Odo left. He recently caught a goblin sneaking around near the river.
        ◦ They were childhood friends, always getting into trouble together. He doesn’t remember anything about Odo’s disappearance in the Loop Woods (he was only 10 at the time).
        ◦ I confirmed that Angela was too far to have crossed paths with Sear’Rebellion, John asked me if it was to set her up with someone better than Theo. It was to have Sear’Rebellion say hi, but we joked about Angela’s poor taste in men anyway.
    • Odo reconnects with his dad on the road, while the rest of the Far Flung Fellowship rides ahead. Kaz teleports Lana into the secret cellar, Lana uses Stone Shape to fix the floor, and they teleport back out.
    • Meanwhile, Odo demands the truth from his dad about where his family came from and who they are. He coldly asks his father why a tarot reader in Sigil had called him ‘second born’, and his father simply says ‘nonsense’. Odo pretends to agree and says “I just wanted to hear it from you” (though he isn’t very convincing). 
    • After a while, his father asks where he’d heard the rumor, and Odo explains he heard it from someone in Sigil. His father sighs, and says that Odo is old enough he might as well learn. He explains that a devil placed a curse on their family, and that the firstborn son of each generation is taken. He makes Odo promise to avoid devils in case the curse has other effects.
        ◦ Odo asks if there’s a chance that his sibling is still alive. His father says he doesn’t know, but not to go looking.
        ◦ Odo asks where the curse came from, and his father says he doesn’t know. (and Odo fails his insight check to find out if he’s lying)
        ◦ Odo asks if his father ever looked into the curse more deeply, and if any of the books in his study were related to his search. His father simply says “no”. (bullshit)
        ◦ Regarding the study: “If I should die, then and only then I want you to… well, it’s best that we don’t talk about such things now”
    • Othar and Odo reach Falcon’s Roost. Othar has Odo wait outside the study while Othar gets his gift. Odo waits outside, sweating, until his father returns with a puzzled expression and the set of mithril half-plate.
        ◦ Othar helps Odo put on the armor. It’s so light it’s almost like he’s not even wearing armor. It can be worn under clothes, and no one needs to know he’s wearing armor.
    • The party is quite taken with Odo’s gift. Nev and Lana try to attack Odo, while Kaz (per usual) refuses to use offensive magic against her friend. Afterward, we all stand proudly. Othar gets a little misty-eyed, seeing a Falcanspur and a Moonstar standing together again.
    • We leave the manor and head into Loop Woods. Lana plucks a few mushrooms off her hat, places them on the ground, closes her eyes, and concentrates. The mushrooms sprout mycelia, which burrow into the ground and commune with the rest of nature. Lana spreads her awareness, searching for the bust of the bear with the raised claw and the diadem with the crescent moon and stars. The forest shows her the exact path to the shrine, very hidden in the trees. She also learns that bears frequent the shrine.
        ◦ the crescent moon isn’t exactly a Selune symbol, but its thematically similar.
    • We follow the hidden path up over a crag and down towards the clearing. As we approach, we’re flanked by two enormous, snarling bears. Odo places his weapons down and walks up to the two bears. They cut him off from the sculpture, sniff him, rear onto their hind legs and roar, and part to let him pass.
        ◦ Lana casts Speak With Animals to speak with the guardian bears, who tell us that Odo belongs by the shrine, but we do not. One says “The trees said that he was one of the people of this place.” The other bear chimes in to add “When we were young.”
        ◦ Lana asks what the shrine is and who built it. The bears don’t know the details, only that they must guard it. It is sacred to bears.
        ◦ Kaz uses Detect Magic to detect Evocation magic suffusing the clearing, but particularly concentrated on the statue
    • Odo walks into the clearing and cautiously examines the statue. He gets down on his knees, gripping the stone sculpture between his hands. Unable to find any secret levers or buttons, he tries praying to the mother bear who sheltered him when he was young (and who the statue reminds him of).
    • Nevaeh feels a sense of calm reassurance in the clearing, and realizes that it’s sacred, hallowed ground. She thinks it might even be sacred to Selune.
    • Odo inspects the back of the statue, finds a plaque covered in moss. He scrapes off the moss and finds a one-word inscription in runes he can’t read. He borrows a pen and a page of Kaz’s journal to copy down the runes. None of us recognize the runes, and the bears don’t know anything about them either.
    • Nevaeh suggests waiting to see if the moonlight reveals anything about the sculpture. We wait. In the evening, a giant walking tree appears. The bears bow their heads to it. Odo walks out and bows as well. The tree says, in Common, “You’ve returned”
        ◦ Odo: “I’m glad I have. I’ve been missing this peace. I’ve been remembering”
          Treant: “Have you spoken to your ancestor?”
          Odo: “I believe I need to, but I have not”
          Treant: “You just need to try. This is as good a place as any.” They turn to leave “You’re all they have left”
    • Odo returns to the sculpture and meditates, calling up memories from when he was here as a child. He remembers looking at the sculpture before, and finds himself seeing a vision of this place filled with people dressed in archaic ceremonial clothing. They kneel before the altar, the full moon shining above, when suddenly one transforms into a bear. The rest quickly follow. The vision ends.
        ◦ Odo relays the vision to the rest of the party. The moon that evening is a waxing gibbous, so we can’t test Odo’s ability that night.
    • We take a long rest, leave the woods, and head towards the portal to Sigil. At Amphail, we see a column of Waterdhelvian soldiers marching north toward the front lines. It’s a LOT of soldiers. We pass the soldiers, only to be passed a few minutes later by a flotilla of 10 gryphon-riders. We turn down the road to Womford. A wyvern with a rider flies by overhead, moving in the same direction as the party. Kaz readies an Eldritch Blast, eyes locked on the wyvern to see if it makes an aggressive move, but it flies by. We’re suspicious, and so we speed up.
        ◦ A soldier explains that they’re heading north to fight in the war. Orcs, goblins, even dragons are fighting on the other side. The soldier thinks it’s blue dragons (electric breath).
    • Wary that the wyvern is flying to make trouble in Womford, Smutlana turns into an owl and flies ahead to see what’s up. She sees a few roofs on fire, and some gryphon riders fighting some wyverns. On the ground, armored figures are fleeing across the bridge into town. In the far distance, she can see the dust of armies clashing, and giants towering over the battles.
    • We ride hard for Amphail. As we arrive, we see that most of the town has evacuated past the bridge, and they’re getting ready to collapse it. Kaz yells at them not to pull the bridge down until we’ve crossed.
        ◦ Edrick Lord Tesper: “Are you crazy?! There’s a war going on!”
          Kaz: “Good! I’ve been looking for one!”
    • We see armored hobgoblin corpses lying on the ground. Most of the guards’ wounded and dead have been pulled back over the river. It appears that a large, ongoing battle has been fought here, and that both sides have recently pulled back to recover their losses. Nev stops to give last rights to the one guard corpse we come across, and the rest of us stand guard around her.
    • A pair of wyvern-riding goblins fly by 100ft overhead, attacking the Far Flung Fellowship. Kaz casts Synaptic Static, and the world around the wyverns/riders twists incomprehensibly for a moment. Odo hears one of the goblins say “burn them” and they launch fireballs at us.
    • We defeat the wyverns and their riders. We take a moment to rest and recover, then head toward the tavern “before it burns down.” We come across an enormous creature (gray rider) with a heavily armored hobgoblin warlord riding it, and the fight begins anew
    • Kaz kills the warlord by blasting him, then driving him screaming mad until he dies. The gray rider goes berzerk. Lana polymorphs it into a fox, which immediately bites Kaz for killing its master.
    • We turn back and grab the horses, then gallop toward the tavern. It’s heavily on fire, but the door is still intact. Kaz hops off Solana to open the portal, and the others hop off their own horses to lead them through the door.
    • We head back to our home. Jevrin informs us that Lady Renalia has requested our presence.
    • As we rest, Kaz uses the Rod of Understanding to give Odo Comprehend Languages so he can understand the runes he copied. They can be read as “Ursina Tribe” or “Ursina Clan”
