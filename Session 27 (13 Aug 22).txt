    • We spend the evening of Eliasus 5 thinking of things to ask Exilicor about our Mt Whrith visions. 
        ◦ Kaz can think of many planes with deserts like the one in her vision. Avernus, first plane of the Nine Hells, is a giant desert
    • Kaz casts Contact Other Plane. Her vision shifts to a kaleidoscopic view of the universe, connection forms as a bright spherical glowing entity fills field of vision, too blinding to make out detail but eyes don’t hurt
        ◦ Do you know which plane the Netherese brought the mythallar to?: Kaz feels her mind being searched, feels herself think things unbidden, and is left with a sense of noncomprehension (unclear)
        ◦ Is it possible to destroy the conduit?: another mind search, then Exilicor seems to be trying to make somehting appear in her mind. She finally gets “maybe”
        ◦ Are we being followed or spied on?: unclear (Kaz gets the feeling that Exilicor can pull thoughts from her brain and understand things, but still has trouble understanding things in detail)
    • Kaz pauses to convey lack of clarity in her conversation to the others, decides to find out more about the nature of the connection rather than pursuing specific questions about Asger Mordelin and Ranjat Dor’alkaba that Exilicor probably wouldn’t know anything about
        ◦ Do you know what a plane is?: Kaz sees images of the planes she’s been to, repeated on loop. She gets the sense that the answer is “maybe”
        ◦ Is there anyone or anything else like me who talks to you?: Kaz can feel Exilicor dwelling on the word “talks”, calling up linguistic information like they’re trying to understand the present tense. Finally, she gets the response “no”
        ◦ before the connection drops, Exilicor probes Kaz’s mind a little more, just curiously
    • Lana and Kaz discuss the fact that Drosys may have been in contact with Exilicor. Kaz thinks he was, but that he didn’t care much about Exilicor as anything other than a power source (since he kept using the Conduit). She’s been hesitant to ask Exilicor about Drosys and bring up bad memories.
    • The party talks over their respective visions a bit more before going to bed. Kaz reiterates that she thinks the fiends from Nevaeh’s vision were the “fell prince and princess” from the last prophecy of Hecorius. 
        ◦ The party tries to think of possible princes or princesses who could fit the bill. There’s Demogorgon, prince of demons. Myska the Wolf Spider is another prince of demons, and Asmodeus is sometimes called the Prince of Hell. No “fell princess” comes to mind
        ◦ The “prince” was ogre-sized, with red skin and red hooves, 4 arms, and a dog head and a snake head coming out of its neck
    • The next morning, Nev goes to have tea with Priestess Asara. The rest of the party goes shopping for souveniers to give to friends and family
        ◦ Asara has a barky little dog named Maggy, named after Megara (chief of Selune’s Shards, the angels of Selune). Asara says she saw the actual Megara in Sigil about a year prior, which was unusual (and exciting for her) but not unheard of
        ◦ Asara asks Nev’s opinion on marriages for priestesses of Selune, and Nev encourages her to be happy. Asara smiles
        ◦ Nev tells Asara about her Mt Whrith vision. Asara is horrified, doesn’t recognize the fiends in the vision, but promises to let her know if she finds out anything
    • The party reunites at home. Jevrin returns from Lady Renalia’s estate to let the party know that Womford is the nearest town to Waterdeep with a portal to Sigil. It’s still a ways from the city proper, so the party will either need horses once they arrive or will need to charter a riverboat.
        ◦ the portal key is a wooden box
    • The party enters the portal and emerges from a tavern door on a street in a small village. The sun is high in the sky and it’s fairly hot outside. There’s a platoon of chainmail-wearing Waterdavian guardsman marching through a nearby street, which is unexpected for a small town like Womford
    • Kaz asks a local about the extra security and they say there’s a goblin war going on (and act askance that she doesn’t know anything about it, even though she says she and her friends were from out of town)
    • Nev asks another local which ways are the safest to reach Waterdeep. He says that the roads should still be safe (the long way, adds a week to the trip), but people travelling by river have seen goblins flying on wyverns overhead.

    • Normally perennial enemies, the Ice Shield Orcs and Urshani hobgoblins have unexpectedly allied and are rampaging across the countryside. The town Sicumber is now gone.
    • Nev goes up to Edrick Lord Tesper, one of the Waterdavian nobility and currently commanding the Waterdavian guards. Tesper explains that the safest way to reach East Amphail is to go downriver to Goldenfields, then to travel on horseback to Amphail. From Amphail, the party can reach Waterdeep if they choose.
        ◦ Two members of the Waterdavian griffin cavalry swoop by overhead as they speak
        ◦ Lord Tesper says he and his forces are still monitoring what the orcs’ and hobgoblins’ intentions are
        ◦ East Amphail is where Falcon’s Roost, the Falcanspur ancestral home, is located and where Othar Falcanspur typically lives over the summer. The Falcanspurs train and sell horses
        ◦ Goldenfields is an enormous walled monastery to Chauntea, goddess of earth. They farm most of Waterdeep’s produce.
    • We buy horses from Goldenfields. Nev and Kaz get Lana to ask the horses who’s the best among them. All the horses claim to be the best, but half of them talk themselves down to avoid being purchased (because they’re lazy). Nev gets one of the horses calling themself the best. Kaz gets a horse that likes her. Odo gets a strong young horse that wants to be lazy and left behind
        ◦ we can sell the horses back when we return if they’re in good health. we bought them for 75gp apiece
    • We make it to the Falcon’s Roost at nightfall. Marshal Blackheath appears on the wall. “Odo? Oh thank the gods. Your father and mother will be so relieved.” He welcomes us inside and lets us know that Odo’s family is in Waterdeep
    • Marshal Blackheath says there hasn’t been much news of the war in Amphail. The Lord’s Alliance has met about what to do, and has hired Sir Gondrian and his Gallavanters to serve on the front lines.
        ◦ Sir Gondrian returned safely with the refugees from Fort Gilbert, though there were a few casualties. They were tracked by a dragon on the way to the city, and some stayed to hold it off while the rest kept going.
        ◦ Lord’s Alliance: Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and a few other cities that have banded together for mutual defense and information-sharing (medieval NATO)
    • That night, Odo dreams of his childhood, remembers being led back into his room after having been away for a long time. He hears “He’s catatonic. Lay him down in the bed.” A sigh. “I hope he’ll be alright”
    • The next morning, Odo gives everyone a house tour. We stop by Othar’s study and contemplate teleporting inside. Initially we decide not to break in, but the temptation proves too much to resist. Nevaeh dispels whatever Abjuration spell Kaz can see protecting the room, and Kaz Dimension Doors Odo inside. Lana turns Nev into a Gaseous Form, letting her slip through the keyhole.
    • We appear in a rectangular room with a desk at one end. Frosted windows sit high on one wall, covered by iron grates with very small holes. The room is covered by wooden bookcases, and an ancient rug from a far-off place sits on the floor. Kaz can see a magical helmet displayed on a shelf, and a couple magical ceramic vials on another shelf.
        ◦ Odo lifts the rug and sees a locked wooden hatch.
    • In for a copper, in for a gold Kaz thinks as she methodically searches the room. She finds a safe in a cabinet with a keyhole hidden behind a series of sliding panels. The bookshelves hold plenty of interesting books about the ancient Netherese empire, the Shadovar, geneaology, and local history, including a couple books accessed frequently and placed back out of order.
        ◦ One frequently accessed book is a geneaology of the local noble families, and opens right to a page about the Ursina family (the lordship who owned the place before Odo’s great grandfather Geremo Falcanspur inherited it through the Ursina female line and the name changed). Notes have been added to the margins of this book, adding in additional family members high up in the tree.
            ▪ Odo notes that his mother has been written in, and a line was drawn connecting her to the same Ursina family. A line connecting Geremo to the Ursina family has been crossed out. Odo had heard rumors in his life that his family was fake nobility (since Geremo inherited a really distant claim), but he hadn’t heard that his mother was linked to the Ursina family before.
        ◦ The other frequently accessed book is a history of the local area, and also opens directly to a page about the Ursina family. It says that they had been in the region since time immemorial, and that they were there before the city of Waterdeep was founded well over a thousand years ago.
        ◦ All the Netherese stuff is about ruins that have been found, which Kaz knows ties into the adventures that Othar, Anova, Branaris, and Jasper went on. There’s nothing about portals or the Uvorin Decemvirate.
        ◦ The Shadovar/The Revived Netherese Empire existed until 1487 (it’s now 1494) when their floating city fell onto an elven city, destroying both. Everyone was glad that the Shadovar fell because they were Not Nice. Shadovar were humans that adapted to the Shadowfell, then returned to the Prime Material. They also worshipped the evil goddess Shar.
    • Kaz also finds the key to the hatch in a secret compartment on the desk. Nev opens it and sees a steep staircase leading down before turning a sharp corner. We all go down and see a room with four suits of armor on armor dummies, and weapons on racks on the wall. As we enter, the four suits of armor glow and come to life, attacking the party!
    • Odo chooses not to rage, having not come to terms with his anger just yet. The armor is resistant to forceful, necrotic, and bludgeoning damage, to name a few.
    • We triumph, undetected by the manor’s other inhabitants since we’re far enough underground that they can’t hear us. All but a cursory glance at the basement would reveal the fighting that had taken place, so we decide to leave the room without taking anything or revealing that we’d been there.
    • Exhausted from the battle, the Far Flung Fellowship decides to rest for one more night at Falcon’s Roost. Nev and Kaz decide to get Nev’s horse Jojo, only to run into the half-elf Jandar Falcanspur (Odo’s first cousin once removed). He and Nev catch up, then he heads inside to say hi to Odo before accompanying Nev and Kaz to the town
        ◦ Jandar is in charge of the stable business, as a family member. He taught Nevaeh how to ride and how to compete in equestrian shows
        ◦ half elves aren’t that common, but they’re not SUPER rare
    • Odo, Kaz, Nev, and Jandar head to town. Jandar and Nev jump hurdles as they go, while Odo tells Kaz about his childhood/funny stories with Jandar
    • Kaz asks Jandar about the war. He says he started to hear about attacks on villages out east roughly a month ago (but not quite as far east as Fort Gilbert. This is roughly at the western boundary of the High Forest). Scout reports indicated that a large army was forming with giants, goblins, and orcs. Jandar has heard that there are even a pair of blue dragons with the army. “In order for a group like that to stay together, there must be a powerful leader”
    • That night, Odo has another dream. He’s in the woods, in front of a HUGE bear, but he knows it’s friendly to him. It indicates for him to follow it, and he does, to a clearing with a pile of stones covered in foliage. The bear pulls back the foliage to reveal a sculpture of a bear with it’s claws out, wearing a diadem with a moon and stars.
    • Nevaeh privately casts Commune that night, asking Selune three questions
        ◦ Were the Shadovar involved in the attack on my parents?: No
        ◦ Were the eladrin involved in the attack on my parents?: No
        ◦ Does the last prophecy of hecorius have anything to do with the war that’s happening here?: Unclear
    • It’s now the 7th of Eliasus. The servants pack us a full day of food and send us off. We ride all the way to the North Gate of Waterdeep, an uneventful journey along the Long Road, then rest in Nevaeh’s townhouse in the Sea Ward for the night.
    • Kaz sends souveniers from Sigil to Angela and her father, along with letters about what she’s been up to.
    • We wake up the next morning and walk around the block to Odo’s other family home. It’s a much larger and nicer townhouse than the one the Far Flung Fellowship has in Sigil. Odo’s sisters Abigail and Lori runs up to Odo and gives him a big hug
        ◦ Lori loves dancing and parties, but gave up on magic a long time ago
    • They catch up briefly, until Odo’s dad appears on the balcony and greets him. His mom appears shortly after, and the whole family catches up. Lori and Abigail spare attention for Nevaeh, but the family doesn’t notice Kaz or Lana much at all. Odo’s sister Bobbi (who hasn’t seen him in two years) shyly appears at the balcony and greets Odo as well.
    • Odo’s dad demands to know where he’s been. Odo explains that he’s been away doing heroic stuff that needed doing, and gives each party member a detailed, formal introduction. Othar shakes each party member’s hand in turn
        ◦ Kaz blushes furiously, face as red as her hair.
        ◦ Othar: “I’m so happy to see you son, I don’t even mind the hour-long introduction”
          Odo: “Well, you know how long-winded we can be”
        ◦ Odo also introduces Lyesgiel as “someone who could not be here today,” showing the carving of Lyesgiel on his shield and explaining how much he misses him and how much he valued his company
    • We retire to the parlor, where Odo tells the story of our adventures. Othar makes clear that he’d assumed Odo had died in the Rezzoradrath incident and wasn’t happy that Odo had left him with that assumption, but was glad he was alive.
    • Othar is fascinated to learn that we made it down into the main Netherese ruin (and that we’d fought a few creatures to make it down there). He asks where we went after we portaled out of there (doesn’t know much about Limbo, but is relieved that its not one of the Hells, and hears that we went to Sigil afterward)
    • Othar is pleased to learn that Nev made contact with her dad, and asks Nev if she’s made any progress on her search for her father. He’s impressed to learn we reached Arborea, since he didn’t think people could reach that plane
    • Odo asks if everything has been okay while he was gone. Othar says that everything has been good except for Odo’s sister. After confirming that the rest of the party are trustworthy friends, he reveals that Odo’s sister Tammy is training to be a paladin in the Order of the Half Moon. Othar doesn’t want his daughter swinging a sword around and risking death. “Nevaeh is strong and you are too. Tammy is not…” he sighs. “She can barely lift a sword! How’s she gonna fight enemies?”
        ◦ Odo admits he isn’t overjoyed by Tammy’s decision, but he stands by her choice, especially because she’s 18
        ◦ Othar blames Nev for inspiring Tammy to become a paladin, since Tammy saw Nev with her strength and shining armor
        ◦ Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 11:50 PM
          Telepathically, Kaz remarks to Nevaeh "but he's willing to let his son swing a sword and die?"
          Nevaeh (Alicia) — Today at 11:50 PM
          shrugs
          Nev's keeping her mouth SHUT lol
          Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 11:53 PM
          Oh so's Kaz lol
    • Othar releases us to explore Waterdeep, with the promise that we’ll be back for dinner. He also arranges a private conversation with Odo after dinner.
    • Odo pulls Bobbi aside and gives her a few trinkets from Sigil, and she seems wowed and happy to see her brother. He also shows off his flaming sword, which shocks and impresses her.
    • We tour the city, guided by Nev and Odo. We visit Nev’s mom’s tomb and pay our respects. We also visit a bunch of tourist spots
        ◦ Castle Waterdeep, Agarron’s Palace (both functioning, can’t tour), Agarron’s Tower (magically sealed Wizard tower), Blackstaff Tower (archmage tower, functioning), Lion Gate at the Field of Triumph, walking statues of Waterdeep (90ft stone colossus statues that can be animated to fight the city’s enemies, currently frozen. Some even have buildings built up on them. The God Catcher statue is in the background of the photo)
    • We’re served an excellent dinner prepared by master chef Terrance. Table conversation is kept to small talk. The girls look bored, but Kaz manages to engage them. After dinner, the group goes to the drawing room for more conversation. Kaz talks more about the history of the Netherese empire with Othar, who’s a wealth of info. He says Gilbert Orenson was introduced to him by a mutual acquaintance, who knew he’d funded other Netherese digs. Othar didn’t know much about the dig beforehand. Kaz explains that they didn’t find much in the main complex, and what they did find was quite inaccessible.
    • Othar talks to Odo in private. He asks if Odo has been going to the Hells/any places with devils, since they want to steal people’s souls. Odo reassures his father that he’s stayed far away from devils. Othar warns him to stay far, far away from devils, and says its very important that he do so
        ◦ WAS ODO SOLD IN A DEVIL’S BARGAIN??
    • Odo relates his Mount Whrith vision to his father, and explains that he feels an overwhelming amount of rage lately, and it feels like “the devil is in him.” He tells his father about the dreams he’d been having lately. His father says it sounds like the time he got lost in the woods as a little boy, but relates the story as though the bear was about to eat Odo before he was saved. He mentions that Odo didn’t remember much afterward. He says Odo was lost in the Loop Woods just north of Falcon’s Roost.
    • Odo says he might want to explore Loop Woods more, and Othar says that he’ll accompany him back to Falcon’s Roost to give him his coming-of-age present
        ◦ all the players assume the gift is the set of mithril half-plate in the secret basement
