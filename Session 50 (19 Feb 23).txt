    • It’s the early morning of Marpenoth 8th.
    • The party decides to teleport to the Sigil portal a bit before noon to meet with Ganth, then planeshift back to the Falcon’s Roost afterward.
    • Odo brings the party to Sear’s room and wakes him up. Sear isn’t happy to be woken up (especially in front of Nevaeh, who he has a crush on), and is VERY hesitant to let Lana cast magic on him that he doesn’t understand. Still, he allows Smutlana to restore his ripped-off arm with a cynical “It can’t get much worse, can it?”
        ◦ a maid named Molly directs us where to find him
    • Smutlana holds several food scraps to Sear’s arm as raw material for the spell. He puts mushrooms onto the meat scraps, which root into the meat and cover it as the arm begins to regrow. Sear takes one look at the fungal mass encasing his shoulder and passes out. Lana doesn’t waver, continuing to cast the spell until the fungal growth itself sloughs off, revealing a fresh arm underneath. A wave of regenerative energy spreads over his body, wiping away the heavy scarring from healed over ambush wounds
    • Ogres came suddenly, knocked the walls down and started killing everyone. Sear tried to wake everyone up, and managed to kill a few of the dozens of ogres before one ripped his arm off. He saw the ogres and onis had Marshall and Jandar, and they killed them. He stumbled to the stables, grabbed his horse, and fled. He thought he saw a man as he ran, wearing a black and red robe
    • Odo swears his vengeance on the people who attacked the roost. Kaz tells Sear about the party’s enemyship with Asger. Odo confirms that he had warned his father about Asger, but Othar replied that those who fight for good often make enemies. Odo assumes that his father thought Asger was an empty threat. Sear tells Odo that he has to kill Asger, and Odo readily swears that he will. Satisfied, the party lets Othar know they’ll meet up with him at Falcon’s Roost in the evening and heads back to Sigil to wait for the meeting with Ganth.
    • Kaz realizes that she needs a quick way to Planeshift the party OFF of the Prime Material plane, if necessary. She heads to the zone between the Market Ward and the Lady’s Ward, where the high-end shops are located. She goes to one of the magic shops and buys a tuning fork attuned to the Outlands, which (as the plane she’s currently on) is the easiest properly-tuned fork to obtain.
    • Nevaeh prays for Marshall and Jandar and the other souls lost at the roost. She also casts Commune.
        ◦ Were the ogres being mind controlled to attack Falcon’s Roost?: No
        ◦ Did the ogres travel to and from Falcon’s Roost on foot?: Yes
        ◦ Were the ogres looking for the contract, specifically?: No (but with a sense that the answer isn’t totally clear)
    • Odo looks around for a place to get a tattoo. He hears about the legendary tattoo artist Fel, a dabus. He’s the only dabus who doesn’t float, and some say he was defrocked by the Lady of Pain for committing some crime.
    • Ganth teleports into our living room at noon. He explains that the Watchful Voyagers have decided that we should meet at their headquarters, since they’re very protective of their resource’s location and nature. He also says that for us to visit the HQ, he has to place a Geas (“Gesh”) on all of us. The Geas would compel us not to reveal anything about their base, or be killed by magic (it’s sometimes possible to survive the magic, but Ganth looks pretty powerful).
        ◦ We realize that Lysegiel was probably under a Geas not to attack Asger.
    • We submit to the Geas, and Ganth teleports us to a building. He uses a portal key to open a door, then directs us through. We end up in a cave. Ganth turns to us, says “Very well. Now we shall head to Brin's Haven,” pulls out a tuning fork, rings it, and casts Planeshift.
        ◦ named after our late leader, Bryndicus, who died in an ambush by fiends
    • A sphere of light expands out around us, then suddenly collapses inward. We’re shot through a dizzying tunnel of light and color into Brin's Haven.

    • We’re looking up at a towering ziggurat structure with many windows. A similar ziggurat-like structure stands nearby, with a cantilevered-bridge between the two. The sky is a dome that curves down to the ground and is enchanted to look like a sky. Ganth explains that it’s a demiplane as he takes us to Torbold. 
        ◦ Only the stuff in the dotted line is on the ground. Everything else is cantilevered levels 50ft up. Dark green rugs are spread beneath the cantilevered sections. It’s enormous, and would clearly take years to build through normal means. The dome alone is 400ft across.
    • We’re led inside one of the buildings and onto a large circular platform. Ganth puts his hand onto a panel and the platform rises up past 16 floors. He leads us past several offices until we reach Torbold’s.
    • Odo tells the Watchful Voyagers about the attack on the Falcon’s Roost. Torbold hasn’t seen any evidence of fiends coming after us, but advises us to bring our vulerable friends and family to Brin's Haven (especially with Asger on the hunt).
        ◦ Kaz recognizes that the greatest threat to Asger finding her father (and Torthyr overall) is her connections in Silverymoon. Of those connections, only Angela would probably remember the exact name of her village.
        ◦ We also agree to move Gilbert Orenson to Brin's Haven, to keep him out of Asger’s hands
    • We talk a little more about Asger and his connection to the demoness who cursed Branaris. Torbold remarks that Asger is probably linked to forces beyond his own power, and we relate that Asger is probably working for Graatz. Ganth points out that Graatz is known for his many complex and layered schemes, and could very well be behind everything.
    • Torbold says that he has a mission for us – to go back to the group’s old corp headquarters with the Vigilant Sentinels and recover some of the things they left behind there (which they’ll need to disguise us so we can infiltrate Grenpoli). He then shares a key secret with us, something that no fiend can be allowed to discover: The WV possess the knowledge and tools to make what they call “fiend suits,” which are so realistic that even powerful fiendish lords can look at them and not realize that a mortal is inside. It’s a physical object, so Truesight doesn’t work on them.
        ◦ Fiend suits are how Torbold, Ganth, and Boswell followed us through Zeletar.
        ◦ The Vigilant Sentinels are headquartered in Castle Brightspire, in the first layer of Elysium (Amoria). Torbold remarks that it no longer seems like a functioning fortress, more like a destination for the curious. It has a number of large towers, some of which used to belong to the WV.
    • Kaz asks why the VS didn’t know about the fiend suits, and Torbold says that the WV kept them secret. She asks why there were trust issues between the VS and the WV, even before the celestial corruption. Torbold explains that th VS had become more buerurcratic and were never as concerned about direct intervention in the lower planes as the WV were. In fact, the WV always functioned slightly separately from the main organization. There were always slight trust issues and differences of opinion, but Lord Querial had only recently been corrupted along with the other celestials.
    • Torbold takes us to meet his chief artificer, Chazzick De’Gargan, on the 4th basement level. Chazzick is a gnome in a robotic exoskeleton with extendable legs. His eyes move independently of each other as he looks us over. Torbold explains that Chazzick left behind his trisigulator in favor of his “more important” marble collection. 
        ◦ Chazzick is a genius, and he’s really the only one who knows how to use the trisigulator (which makes the fiend suits).
    • Odo asks Chazzick to show off his marble collection, which he gleefully does. Torbold shows the rest of us the fiend suits, and explains that the WV are running out of them. To make more devil suits for our mission, we need to get into Castle Brightspire and get the trisigulator hidden in Chazzick’s secret vault, which can be accessed via his office. 
    • The plan is to go into Castle Brightspire (and the town inside) as sightseers. Chazzick’s workshop and vault are in an underground section beneath the castle. There’s a hidden entrance in the crypt where all the VS commanders have been interred for centuries, which leads to a storage closet in the hallway near his office. They can give us the key to Chazzick’s office and the combination for the safe which opens his vault. It’s possible to teleport out of the vault, but not in.
    • We agree to the mission, and the Watchful Voyagers help to equip us with tools, armor, and weapons. We’re also given a Bag of Holding that won’t show up under a Detect Magic spell, and Ganth enchants our other bag so it can’t be detected either. Meili agrees to loan her magical shield to Nevaeh, but only if Nevaeh agrees to leave something with equal sentimental value behind. Nev leaves her own shield with Meili, since it belonged to her mother, and the two get to talking about the stories behind the nicks and scuffs on their shields.
        ◦ Meili explains that she recently got her shield on a trip to the Beastlands, so no one in the Vigilant Sentinel HQ would recognize it.
        ◦ Kaz gets a tuning fork that will allow the party to planeshift into Brin's Haven, or into the Ethereal Plane (but not to a specific location in the Ethereal Plane, since it’s attuned to the Brin's Haven demiplane)
        ◦ Torbold mentions offhand that he longs to return to Elysium. Kaz offers to bring him something back, and he excitedly asks for a bottle of spiced Athorian wine
        ◦ Torbold also warns us that if we try to travel on foot through Elysium, we’ll be subject to the Traveler’s Travail (which means it will be necessary to do good deeds along our route)
    • We head back to Sigil to rest before heading out to Falcon’s Roost. A few Watchful Voyagers come along to bring Gilbert back to Brin's Haven, and he goes along willingly. Before he leaves, he very hesitantly confesses that Asger forced him to reveal who Odo was (though he didn’t reveal any information about the rest of us, even when Asger hit him, because he didn’t know it himself). Kaz thanks him for letting us know, and wishes him a better future.
    • Kaz spends a bit of time at the library looking into the geometric designs on the Conduit, trying to pin down any information on it. She looks up Elvish visual art and design from Abeir-Toril, since Drosys found the mirror in some Elvish ruins. In one book, she finds block printed art styles that resemble the one on the mirror, and she gets the sense that the mirror is from an ANCIENT period.
    • That evening, we slip through a portal to a bit of wilderness in the Outlands. Kaz focuses hard, then carefully mimics Ganth’s exact moves as she casts Planeshift. Sure enough, she feels her borrowed power expand outward, then snap inward, sending everyone tumbling through space until they touch down feet-first in the Prime Material. Kaz jumps around excitedly, extremely proud of herself, and the rest of the party joins her.
        ◦ When Kaz casts Planeshift, the party sees the world rip open, but leaves the Prime Material before they can see what lies beyond.
    • We hike through the Loop Woods towards the column of smoke in the distance. As we break through the trees, we see dozens of people on horseback and picking through the still smoldering ruins. Many are from the nearby village of Amphail, who are happy to help the Falcanspurs. Othar is there beside Sir Gondrian.
    • Othar learns from Odo that Asger was the one to attack the Falcon’s Roost. He makes sure that Asger isn’t planning to attack any other Falcanspur. Lana cools the embers with water from a nearby river, and the party begins to help search the ruins. Kaz and Lana find a cluster of skeletons in what was once the grand welcoming hall, and deduce that they were beheaded before the building burned. Together, they work to piece together individual skeletons.
    • Nevaeh pulls out a 1000gp diamond and sits for an entire hour, praying, with the entire party around her. Nev glows as she casts Resurrection, and an image of Selune appears over her as if watching over Nev. Jandar’s body glows as well, obscuring the actual process of the body knitting itself back together. Nevaeh feels herself connect to Jandar’s spirit as he heads for an afterlife, and she begs him to return with her. She says that he’s family, and she doesn’t have a lot of people left, and she needs him. She hears him say “Alright, I guess.”
    • Jandar returns to life, initially disoriented, but then panicked as he remembers what happened to him. Nev hugs him to calm him down, and Kaz piles on in a group hug (distressed by having held his skull in her hands). The rest of Othar’s retainers stand back, gobsmacked at having seen an extremely powerful cleric raise a person from the dead, and looking at Jandar like he’s a ghost. Eventually, someone brings him some clothing.
        ◦ Nev can tell that Jandar has some memories of his death. He tries to be helpful and explains that ogres burst in without warning. He tried to grab weapons, but there were too many of them, and they cut his head off.
    • Othar agrees to take Jandar to the inn. Jandar saw Sear’Rebellion taking down two ogers before ripping his weapon arm off, and is glad to hear he survived. He thanks Nevaeh for calling him back. She thanks him for coming back, and he says “Couldn’t leave you alone, could I?”
    • The party spends the night at the inn Amphail. Kaz comes into Nev’s room to find her asleep in a prayer position. She awkwardly offers to leave if Nev is busy, but Nev welcomes her inside. Kaz asks how she’s feeling after such a physically and emotionally taxing resurrection, and Nev says she’s doing better. Kaz is glad to hear it, but something is clearly on her mind. She explains that, as Nev knows, Kaz’s mom died in a carriage accident when Kaz was young. Her family didn’t have the money to cover the cost of a Resurrection spell, and even when Kaz earned 1000gp adventuring it still wouldn’t have covered the additional cost set by a cleric who’d have to cast such a taxing spell. And, she explains in a rush, even now that Nevaeh is powerful enough to cast Resurrection, Kaz still isn’t sure she wants to resurrect her mom. She asks Nevaeh if that makes her a bad person, and Nev reassures her that it doesn’t. Sometimes, even if it’s sudden, it can still be someone’s time to go, and it’s fine for Kaz to want her mom to be at peace in her own afterlife. Kaz nods, but explains that she does want her mom back, but she doesn’t want to exhume her body, and what if she doesn’t want to come back, and what if, and what if. Nev slows her down, hands on her shoulders, and Kaz nods gratefully. She sighs. “I think… I want my ma back, but I think now isn’t the right time. Especially not with Asger out there, huntin’ the people I love. I can’t lose her again, I can’t, I can’t, I just can’t.” Nev smiles. “When this is all over, and we get to go home, I’ll go with you. And I’ll bring her back to you.” Kaz hugs Nev gratefully.
    • The next morning, we put all our magical items in the bags of holding, then Planeshift to the city of Release From Care (the largest city in the layer of Amoria). The town is picturesque, with kites flying overhead and the smell of summer flowers. It’s like a good dream.
    • We get directions to the ferries, then set off to the Oceanus River, which heads from Elysium through the Beastlands into Arborea. Everyone is very friendly, and everything feels wonderful. We board the Silver Dolphin for a few silver pieces, then make our way upstream to Brightspire. We pass rolling fields of wheat, with farmers waving to us as we pass by. Kaz pulls out the Planar Sextant and sees that the whole plane has a sort of glow to it. She takes many notes.
    • The 5 hours to reach Brightspire pass easily and almost without notice. Eventually, we come around a bend and see an enormous fortress with 12 colorful towers, in front of a picturesque Mount Snowflank. An enormous waterfall tumbles down the side of the mountain. Light blue banners wave from the castle walls, emblazoned with a silver shield surrounded by 7 flowers. The gold and blue central tower is called the Lance, and is where the administration meets. The ferry pulls to a stop, we make our way into the castle’s open door with the other tourists, and easily walk inside.
    • We see three taverns as we walk in: the Crystal Chalice, the Blazing Sun, and the Serene Unicorn. Nev and Odo eagerly point the group in the direction of the Serene Unicorn. The wooden sign is a resting unicorn with a maiden petting it’s mane. The tables have white tablecloths, and there’s a garden with a fountain. The party has a few glasses of Avathorian Red (it’s very good), then decides to enjoy a nice lunch as well. The restaurant doesn’t serve meat, so we get a delicious salad which makes up for the low availability of fresh produce in Sigil.
        ◦ Avathoria is a region of Elysium. Kaz buys Torbold a nice bottle.
    • We head to the Golden Bazaar. There are several Vigilant Sentinels walking by, along with a few citizens. Nev buys a few purple roses (which match the top rose on the Vigilant Sentinel crest) and a fancy box to give them to Cpt. Cloudsilver. There’s a toymaker selling models of guardenelles (anthropomorphic celestials. We’ve met Chiprick the mustevelle before). Kaz buys a mustavalle that reminds her of Chiprick as a souvenier. Smutlana purchases a few Elysian mushrooms, making sure to ask the vendor about growing conditions (since Elysian mushrooms are extremely difficult to grow outside of Elysium). Odo goes around sampling food like it’s Costco
    • We make our way to the Temple of the Radiant Dawn, an all-faiths temple with an enormous silver spire that honors a number of Elysian deities (and generally all good deities). Dawn deities are particularly well represented, and we know that Lythander the Morning Lord resides in Elysium. Nearby is the tower that once housed the Watchful Voyagers, which now has a banner with a sword cleaving through a shield. We head inside and pass several solemn worshippers making offerings and lighting candles.
    • There are two entrances to the crypt: one in the floor behind the altar and one against the side wall. Both are very visible to the rest of the temple. Lana convinces some birds to fly in a circle outside the front door and sing a song as a distraction while the party slips into the side passage.
    • We creep through the crypt to the bay where the Vigilant Sentinel commanders are interred, and hear footsteps moving through the crypt. Lana and Nev work together to push the secret passageway button on the back of an angel statue’s head
