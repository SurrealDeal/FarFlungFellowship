    • The dwarves gladly accept food, money, and the dwarven rune tablet from the party, unsure how they can ever repay us. They thank us again, then set off for Citadel Adbar (the magma elementals have apparently seen the writing on the wall and left). 
    • We debate whether to take the hoard to Lady Renalia’s Treasury and Transfer (Lana) or to the Starglimmer (Kaz). Lana maintains that most rich people use the T&T and that it’s well set up and safe. Kaz argues that the world is becoming more unstable and Sigil is currently unsafe, and she’s worried the party won’t be able to get their money back out of the bank.
    • While we take a short rest, Nev casts Commune
        ◦ Did someone on the Starglimmer betray our position when we reached the Plane of Water?: No one did, to the extent that it’s possible to divine (she gets the sense that the Starglimmer itself is protected from Divination, and it’s not possible to see what happened on it)
        ◦ Can we trust that Cpt Cloudsilver is on our side?: Yes
        ◦ Did someone at the Brin’s Haven meeting give away our location to our enemies?: Nev gets the sense that the meeting was also shadowed from divination.
    • We start organizing the hoard for transport. Odo heads upstairs and sees an orc skeleton shambling forward to attack him. He slashes it down in two blows, but more soon follow it down the hall. Two giant skeletons lumber out as well, and Odo yells for the rest of the party.
    • The party leaps into battle against the undead. Odo chops down skeletons left and right, and Lana reclaims one of the fallen skeletons as a Heather. Nev does a deep bow and casts Destroy Undead on the skeletons, wiping out an entire wave of skeletons with moonlight and causing the two giant skeletons to run in fear (Heather counts as a plant creature and is unaffected).
    • Xerfilioc’s shambling corpse walks out from the hallway, burned flesh hanging off his face, and casts Circle of Death on Odo, Lana, and Nev (the only ones close enough to hit). Kaz bottlenecks the door with Sickening Radiance, holding back even more orc skeletons.
    • The battle rapidly takes a turn for the worst, as more and more skeletons rush into the room and overwhelm the party. Odo is knocked unconscious and beaten to death before anyone can help him. Kaz teleports herself and Nev out the temple door, near Xerfilioc, Lana, and Odo’s body.
    • We just barely manage to make it out of the “temple” to Rezzoradrath and planeshift back to Brin’s Haven with Odo’s body. A nearby healer manages to cast Gentle Repose on Odo, preserving his body so that Nev can cast Revivify on him once she’s had a short rest. Odo gives a long, rambling speech to express his gratitude.
        ◦ sadly, we do not manage to hang onto the painting
    • We take a moment to rest. Lana gathers that the attack was not planned for us (one orc ran in ahead of the others, the giant skeletons were probably there to carry heavy goods, etc). The undead were probably there to get the hoard, since Asger also knew the dragon was dead.
    • We give the WV an update on what we’ve been up to, including that we successfully destroyed the Conduit. They pass the news on to Torbold and leave us to rest.
        ◦ Leehan seemed genuinely glad to hear that the Conduit was destroyed.
    • Kaz goes to check up on her family and friends, and finds them learning about the planes and about the Watchful Voyagers. They’re doing well.
    • The Brin’s Haven population seems to have increased, with a lot more new civilian recruits. It seems like everyone is making sure that everyone they know is here. We see a group of school children playing with a ball in the grass.
    • After we rest, Torbold comes to tell us that he’s sending scouts out to the Lower Planes (as usual) to find out if any of their information channels have changed and generally monitor the situation with the Black Rings. He’s curious to know if the fiends will be reacting to the Conduit’s destruction.
    • Nev receives a Sending from Laura Montbarrik, the assistant spelljammer on the Starglimmer. She says: “Priestess, the starglimmer just escaped an ambush at Marvinia. At least 5 chaos ships. Captain recognized a man named Asger. The base has been destroyed. [another casting] please don’t attempt to planeshift there, enemy vessels control area. Starglimmer heavily damaged. Making repairs in Astral. Crew all safe. Lady Renalia’s network likely compromised.”
        ◦ We gather that a “chaos ship” is something like the giant mutant demon-shaped ship that Asger was on in Agathys.
    • Kaz tries to contact Exilicor that evening, but is unsuccessful and goes insane. She hangs out with the party for the following day, then tries again that evening and succeeds.
        ◦ “I destroyed the Conduit. It’s gone.”: “I know. Good.”
        ◦ “Have you ever been connected with other beings like me, other than Drosys?”: yes
        ◦ “Were they like me (as opposed to something like a mindflayer)?”: affirmative, with some uncertainty
        ◦ “Did they contact you frequently?”: unsure/unclear (confusion, doesn’t seem to understand what Kaz means by “contacting”)
        ◦ “Can you hear anything through the mythallar?”: no

Nevaeh (Alicia) — 06/29/2023 12:02 AM
Okay, my first sending is going to be to Asara
"Priestess, How are you and Rafe? Are you still in Sigil? What's the status of things at the temple? we're okay"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 06/29/2023 2:41 AM
Totally forgot I have to reply to the sending that the lady sent whose name I can't remember because I don't have my notes. After hearing about the starglimmer - "Thank Selune everyone was able to escape Asger safely. He's incredibly dangerous. Will you be safe where you are now? Please, how can we help?"
John Dungeon Master — 06/29/2023 11:12 PM
Her name is Laura Montbarrik. You don’t get an immediate reply, but you get the idea she may not have that many spell slots
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/02/2023 10:10 AM
second sending to the captain
"Leagair, We just arrived in Brin's Haven and received your message. Thank the goddess you made it out. Are you alright? How can we help?" Sending to Asara is above as well.
John Dungeon Master — 07/02/2023 2:05 PM
She says: “We’re ok. Are you ok? It’s so awful. The shrine was damaged but not too badly. Oh Selûne! Your house! Oh I’m so sorry.”
John Dungeon Master — 07/02/2023 2:14 PM
He says: “We’ve stabilized the ship and we’re hidden here. They somehow found Marvinia. We can’t trust the network, there were a lot of celestials. Stay safe”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/02/2023 2:59 PM
Oof
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/02/2023 3:03 PM
Last sending back to Asara: Priestess, I don't know how else to say this, but you cannot trust Lady Renalia's network right now. Please inform Rafe to be extra vigilant."
John Dungeon Master — 07/02/2023 5:15 PM
She says “oh no! Alright I’ll let him know at once. May the moonlight protect you.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/02/2023 9:38 PM
I'm going to up cast another sending to the captain, "Are you safe from Morgana there too? When were you expecting her to appear? How long do we have to prepare?" Cuz I think he did say at this point she was coming.
John Dungeon Master — 07/03/2023 8:07 PM
(no, he was still holding back so as not to trigger her wrath, and he wouldn’t be in danger, the object of his affection would be) 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/03/2023 8:19 PM
ohhhhhhh got it got it
undoing that upcast sending then
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 06/29/2023 12:15 AM
Odo wants to find Bobbie, say hello, play a bit maybe a game or two of something silly, and ask to borrow the marble back from her that he gave her from the Friendly Fiend - then give that to the party and say:
"Reckon idk, if we done been being tracked by this... but uh... I took it back from Bobbie"
And hand it over to Kaz
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 06/29/2023 12:16 AM
Kaz nods solemnly, sliding the marble into her bag. "Good idea, Odo. We can't be too careful"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 06/29/2023 12:28 AM
Would I have any idea if it's possible to actually like...meet Selune in the way that Smutlana met their god? Kaz talks directly to her uh...totally not evil patron? Or is selune just like...way beyond that.
John Dungeon Master — 06/29/2023 7:51 PM
You know it would be highly sacrilegious to even think about that. Actually, as we've discussed before, the idea of going to Selûne's realm, or even the plane of Ysgard in which it is situated, is deeply taboo, unless you have some sort of special dispensation, like a summons from an angelic messenger.
You fully expect to meet Selûne one day, when you finally die.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 06/29/2023 8:02 PM
Okay, so we can't go to Ysgard. Got it.
John Dungeon Master — 06/29/2023 10:30 PM
If you think you have a good reason, its up to you, but you would know not to take it lightly
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 06/29/2023 8:48 PM
Would it normally be sacrilegious for Lana to go see Psilofyr? Obviously she was summoned to Mycelia when we went. 
John Dungeon Master — 06/29/2023 10:30 PM
Thats hard to say. It’s a very different faith
Generally, meeting a god is not something anyone does
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 06/29/2023 10:34 PM
We've done a lot of things that most people don't do
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/02/2023 9:36 PM
Can one of us send to Nall or Cresta? Not sure we set up a sending link but we have all hung out a fair bit.
John Dungeon Master — 07/03/2023 7:20 AM
You’re probably familiar
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/03/2023 2:01 PM
Then I'd like to also upcast a send to Cresta "Cresta, we need your help and connections if you're able. Can you help sneak us into Sigil in the next day or two?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/03/2023 2:07 PM
(Ooh, I like it!)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/04/2023 1:36 PM
(Since we’ve been back at Brin’s Haven, has Kaz seen anyone who’s concealing their true appearance?)
John Dungeon Master — 07/04/2023 3:00 PM
Nope
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/04/2023 2:05 PM
(Oh, reminds me I want to check in on Jandar and see what he's been up to)
John Dungeon Master — 07/04/2023 11:13 PM
She says: “if you can come to the Guilded Hall in Arborea, I can get you through to the fest hall”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/04/2023 11:35 PM
(I knew I liked those two)
(Do we have any idea where the guilded hall is? we saw very little when we were there, I mean, what we saw was amazing but still)
John Dungeon Master — 07/05/2023 11:29 AM
Just that it’s in the first layer of Arborea
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/05/2023 7:17 PM
(Is there someone in Brin's Haven that might know more about Arborea and the Guilded Hall, so I have a better idea of what to say to Cresta when I reach back out? Like, a general description of it, any markets or anything interesting to see there before we leave again? I might try to connect with Fredryk too and see if he wants to meet there if it makes sense)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 07/05/2023 7:18 PM
Is it famous enough that Kaz would know anything?
John Dungeon Master — 07/05/2023 8:17 PM
You guys have the general knowledge that it’s the headquarters of the society of sensation faction. The faction is banned in Sigil, but in the rest of the planes, it is still active.
John Dungeon Master — 07/05/2023 10:30 PM
You dont know of anyone in the WV who is a sensate, but you know both Asara and Leagair were sensate members
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 07/06/2023 12:24 AM
that's convenient then
