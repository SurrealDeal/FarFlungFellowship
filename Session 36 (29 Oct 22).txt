    • We race after the gray slaad down a long spiralling staircase, and reach a 30x30 room filled with gold and other treasures.
    • We investigate the room, looking for the slaad. Kaz follows the slaad’s apparent trail onto the gold and the pile reveals itself as a hoard mimic, tentacles writhing as it sticks her in place
    • The creature bites Kaz and tries to eat her, but Odo pulls her out of the way. Lana heals her up and Kaz blasts off the tentacles grappling herself and Nevaeh
    • Lana finally kills the creature with a wall of flame, and its corpse crumbles on fire. She finds a stone button on the wall which opens a hidden door, leading to another set of stairs
    • We climb down the hidden stairs and reach another door. Inside is a circular room with a circular etching on the floor. Kaz ritual casts Detect Magic and senses abjuration magic within the circle & illusion magic on the wall directly ahead in a small patch
        ◦ Lana notices that a ten-pointed star is etched above the door we entered through. Kaz considers that the doorway might be a portal similar to the other portal doors in the Decanter Mine complex
    • After plenty of discussion and lack of idea about what to do, Lana sticks her hand into the central circle. An illusory mouth appears across the room and says in Loross “If knowest thou, name them now. The folly-filled ten.” Kaz names each member of the Uvorin Decemvirate and the mouth says “Enter then, friend.” Another hidden door swings open.
        ◦ Loross is a human version of Elvish. Kaz and Nev both know Elvish, and Kaz knows Loross as well, so they can understand the illusion.
    • We proceed downward and enter another room. This one is square, with a hallway leading off ahead of us. There are several doors leading out of the room, a pile of rubble on the floor, two stone slabs, and a rough-hewn structure of a humanoid sitting on a chair.
        ◦ Kaz can see transmutation magic on the slaad and on the sculpture
    • We blast the slaad a couple times before he manages to smash the sculpture. A 7ft tall wizard appears, with a chinbeard reaching down to his chest and a spell glowing at the tip of his staff. Kaz recognizes him as Zeferio, one of the Uvorin Decemvirate from the vision Psilofyr shared with her.
    • Zeferio demands to know who Kaz and her friends are. She introduces herself in Loross and explains that no, they’re not a strike team from the Netherese empire come to rescue Zeferio. Instead, they’re a group of adventurers hunting down an evil wizard, and that Netheril fell 3000 years ago.
    • Zeferio is reluctant to believe Kaz that it’s been 3000 years, even when she pulls out the Modron Law Book and shows him its publishing date (“That’s easy to fake” “But why would I fake it to rob an empty facility?”). Finally, he asks the slaad servant, who stands obediantly at his side, how long its been. It must confirm what Kaz is saying, because his jaw drops and he slumps back into his seat, devastated.
    • Kaz quickly uses the Rod of Understanding to help Lana and Odo listen to the conversation, then cautiously approaches Zeferio. She’s sympathetic, and tries to reassure him that there’s still a world out there to live in, even if it’s an unfamiliar one. She tells him about how far magical research has come since his day, and a bit about the Conclave of Silverymoon.
    • Kaz explains what happened to the Netherese empire, and what happened to the Uvorin Decemvirate specifically. She also gives Zeferio all of the Uvorin Decemvirate necklaces/pendants she’d collected, and reassures him that she and the rest of the Far-Flung Fellowship had done everything they could for what remained of his colleagues (like Erfessa’s spirit)
    • Zeferio asks how Kaz and her friends know so much, and how they’re involved with everything. Kaz briefly explains that their hunt for Asger has brought them along the trail of many Netherese ruins and secrets, and that she, like Drosys, was connected to Exilicor. Zeferio is shocked that she knows so many closely guarded secrets, and she admits that Exilicor pointed her in the right direction.
    • Kaz explains that she became connected to Exilicor through the Conduit, and asked Zeferio what he knew about it. He said it was something Drosys found, one which he wished Drosys had never unearthed (“Otherwise I would be with my family now, instead of here”)
        ◦ Kaz empathizes, saying that she lost her mother when she was young, and she knows how difficult it can be to lose one’s family.
    • Drosys found the Conduit in one of the ancient elven ruins, but Zeferio doesn’t know which one
    • Zeferio pulls out a small book titled “Quotidien incantations of Zeferio” and recites an incantation. We can all speak to each other telepathically.
    • Nersiul and Voekt both wanted to leave. Nersiul grabbed a planar sextant and tried to walk out with Voekt. Zeferio stayed to protect the mythallar. He walked around until he found an enormous crack in the ground, which somehow didn’t close over. He then built the whole facility and lived there for a year before going into stone stasis
        ◦ he thinks something inimical to the world must have caused such a large crack, and that the something probably wasn’t Exilicor since Exilicor doesn’t reach into the world like that. Whatever it was is probably from the upper planes
        ◦ He and his colleagues didn’t have their planeshifting spellbooks on them at the time, so they were essentially trapped in Agathys
    • Lana manages to convince Zeferio to eat a mushcake and drink some water.
    • Zeferio asks what we want his help with. Kaz asks him to help them keep the mythallar out of evil hands, and to help them destroy it and the Conduit. Zeferio If the mythallar came into contact with a creature from the transcosmic domain, it would be destroyed. Destroying it would also release all of it’s stored energy all at once
    • Zeferio pulls out a necklace with a star and crescent symbol, which Nevaeh recognizes as an ancient symbol of Selune. “My wife Anaia convinced me to wear this. She said it would protect me. I suppose in a way it did.” Nevaeh offers to pray for her with him and he accepts, but he’s mostly just nodding along with what she says
        ◦ the party can tell that Zeferio probably wants to cry, but not in front of them
    • Kaz recommends that the party take time to plan how to destroy the mythallar, partly to actually plan and partly to give Zeferio time to himself. Zeferio nods and goes into a side room, which we can see is furnished with a bed and a few other things, and closes the door behind him.
    • We plan and scheme and decide to try to destroying the mythallar by remote-activating the conduit, allowing something from the Far Realm to come through and touch the mythallar. We’d have one of the stone slaad creatures do the activation while we waited miles away to make sure the explosion went off, then to pick up
        ◦ We later realize that this isn’t possible – the only reason that the Far Realm creature managed to break through in the Endopotentiation Chamber is that the Conduit had been used there so many times that it weakened the fabric of reality.
        ◦ We also can’t use the mythallar to open a portal, since it needs to be endopotentiated many times to be powerful enough to do so, and the Conduit takes time to reset between uses
    • Zeferio comes out and announces that he wants to get some rest, and recommends we do as well. Before resting for the night, he unlocks several blast doors with magic and reveals part of a smooth, black, curved surface. We only get that brief glimpse of the mythallar before he comes back out again.
        ◦ Zeferio also transforms several stone slabs into beds for us. He explains that he comes from a family of spellmasons, which is how he was able to build a whole facility by himself. He also has a stone homunculus named Chip
    • The next morning, Zeferio sends Chip to check the complex entrance. Chip sees a torpedo-shaped ship approaching us through the air, with a demonic face on its helm and some sort of claw-like appendages hanging off of it. Hundreds of fungal demons are rushing along the ground, also approaching us, led by the fungal demon lady.
        ◦ Zeferio telepathically shows us what he can see/hear through Chip
    • The fungal army and the flying ship arrive above the complex entrance as the party desperately tries (and fails) to come up with a plan. An enormous flying humanoid figure descends from the craft. It cries out “Xirnaxxsha! It’s me! You knew I was coming!” The figure gets close enough for us to see it’s Asger. He continues “Wait, no, you knew I was coming!” and we realize that part of this conversation between him and the fungal lady must be telepathic. Asger starts to get annoyed. “Calm down! We both know that my lord and master has contacted your queen and that she wants you to cooperate with me.” They continue to argue while the party frantically tries to figure out what to do.
        ◦ pronounced “Zer-knock-sha”
        ◦ “You don’t even care about this artifact, you’re just here because the huge fungus was guarding it!” - Asger to Xirnaxxsha
    • Asger apparently finds out that Xirnaxxsha deteted something in the complex and is pissed that she didn’t say anything about it. Pissed off, he storms down into the complex, eventually reaches us, peeks into our room, and is gobsmacked to see us there.
        ◦ Nevaeh casts Magic Circle to keep out fiends and undead as Asger makes his way down
    • He’s pissed that “that bitch in Silverymoon” lied to him about Kaz and her friends, and assumes that Tinkerreach is also after the mythallar. He recognizes Odo, recognizes Kaz but can’t remember her name, but doesn’t recognize Nev, Lana or Zeferio. He demands to know who sent us, and decides to kill us when we don’t tell him anything.
        ◦ If he recognizes “Odo Falcanspur” but can’t even remember Kaz’s name after hunting down her connections, is his boss the one Odo’s dad (probably) made a deal with? WORSE, is Asger Odo’s demon-snatched brother?
        ◦ Gonna have to warn Tinkerreach that Asger is pissed at her for lying
    • Zeferio reveals Asger as an illusion. The real Asger and Xirnaxxsha start down into the tunnels. Xirnaxxsha gets stuck on the top of Nevaeh’s magic circle, and Asger continues down to fuck us up. Zeferio asks Kaz to telepathically show him which portal the party took to reach Agathys, and says that they might have to flee. Kaz senses that he has a plan.
    • Nevaeh cast Death Ward on Kaz along with the AID stuff at the beginning of the day
