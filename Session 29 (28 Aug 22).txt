    • We ride our horses around the block to Lady Renalia’s home, still covered in grime from our last battle. Our horses are stabled and we’re ushered inside with many surprised looks from the staff.
    • Lady Renalia is seated on a plush, embroidered velvet couch across from another man. He’s very tall, over 6ft (taller than Nev and Odo) with long center-parted blond hair wearing a uniform of some sort. He looks human, but his eyes are glowing a little
    • The man is Cpt. Leagair Cloudsilver. Captain of a galleon named the Moonbeam that Lady Renalia owns. We’re being hired to act as guards, since we’ve sailed the Astral Sea and been to the Lower Planes
    • Things have been a little bit on edge in Lady Renalia’s war-manipulating network, because weapons aren’t reaching the correct combatants to keep the war going. So we’re taking a more direct approach to deliver the shipments where they need to be. We’re bringing anti-fiend weaponry to the fiends, because they can use it against each other but not us
        ◦ TO DO: ask if Lady Renalia recognizes the “fell prince and princess” from Nev’s vision
        ◦ The weapons are made in Arcadia. It’s not totally legal to get it out, but another ship is handling that bit.
    • We’re picking up the weapons in Wildspace (space beyond the air if you keep going up from Toril, basically outer space) and delivering them to an undisclosed location in the Lower Planes.
        ◦ The home port is in realmspace, on an asteroid named Marvinia. We’ll sail through the astral plane between wildspace systems (essentially solar systems, enclosed in crystal spheres)
        ◦ wildspace: outside planet, but inside crystal sphere. busting out of crystal sphere leads to the Astral Plane, which we can sail across
        ◦ realmspace: wildspace around Toril
    • Kaz asks how we breathe on the ship while in Wildspace. Cpt Cloudsilver explains that the ship creates its own air envelope
    • The Captain leads us through a series of portals, first through a city with two moons and plenty of half-orcs and humans (Ordavash), then back to the Outlands (with a view of the infinitely tall spire at the plane’s center), then into an ENORMOUS cavern. We’re standing on a catwalk ledge running along the inside of the cavern. Sailing ships float in the air beside the catwalk, with lines of people bringing supplies up to them.
        ◦ On the way, he asks us about our history and how we found ourselves in Lady Renalia’s employ. Kaz tells him the truth, except when she claims to be a wizard. 
        ◦ Nev gets an upper planar vibe from Captain Cloudsilver, but he doesn’t have pointed ears like she does
    • We’re led to one of the ships, past a number of monkey-like humanoids who greet the captain as we pass. On the sterncastle is a person with a hippopotamus head: Warren Foeslayer, the first mate
        ◦ One of the ships we pass has its main mast broken. Wounded people are being helped off the ship and tended to. There are odd, hairy humanoids walking around everywhere (hadozee).
    • We’re shown to our two cabins near the bow (in the forecastle - “folk-sill”), and told we’ll eat in the officer’s mess at mealtimes. We’re also assigned our destination if a “call to quarters” should occur (aka, if a fight kicks off). We’re told to go midships, below where the captain will be standing, so he can give us further orders during the fight.
    • The ship has three masts, each with four sails. We stand by the middle mast to watch as the ship sets sail. The ship lurches beneath us and begins to sail out as a sailor cries out “Prepare for spell-powered travel!”
    • We look behind us as we get underway and see that we’re sailing out of a hollow asteroid. All around us are twinkling stars and swirling nebulae. The hadozee shipmates spin around us as well, yelling and working to get the ship underway. At a certain point, we get far enough from the asteroid that it suddenly disappears, and we get the sense that we’re suddenly moving much faster.
        ◦ Kaz pulls out her planar sextant out of curiosity, and can just see the crystal sphere in the distance
    • Cpt Cloudsilver smiles and invites us up to the sterncastle with the other officers, since he can tell we’re interested in sailing. He introduces us to Sailing Master Lurton, in charge of coordinating and executing sailing maneuvers. Sails themselves are for steering in wildspace and for actually sailing if we land on water
        ◦ Odo asks how the ship moves. Capt. explains that the ship is a spelljammer, and a magic-user can use a special chair called a spelljammer helm to control the ship.
        ◦ Kaz asks how they navigate, since even though they can just point themselves in any direction and reach the crystal sphere, there’s asteroids to navigate around. Lurton explains that they use the stars to navigate.
        ◦ Kaz also describes the monster that chased the Far Flung Fellowship through the Astral Plane to the officers and ask what it is. They tell her it’s an Astral Dreadnaught, and look terrified.
        ◦ Lana asks how the harpoons work, since we’re in wildspace. One of the hadozee teaches her how to fire it. She also learns that the bolt will fire in a parabola toward the gravity plane of the ship (as if falling to the ground). Once it passes through the plane, it will bend in a parabola in the opposite direction until it passes the gravity plane again. The bolt will continue moving in a sinusoidal path until it reaches the edge of the gravity sphere, at which point it moves straight line constant speed at its current angle and velocity
    • Odo and Nev get a bit seasick, but Kaz and Lana manage to keep their composure. We head to dinner after an hour or so of hanging out with the officers. They tell us about some of the foes we might face, like pirates, githyanki, fiends, angels, and aberrations
    • We learn that our destination is the first layer of the Abyss (there’s a collective gasp, as apparently the other officers didn’t know either). We’re heading to a fortress in a very remote location in the middle of a vast desert, which has been scouted in advance by the captain and a few of Lady Renalia’s other friends. We’re giving the weapons to a particular group of Tenari, devoted blood warriors who are addicted to the warfare against devils.
        ◦ They’ve apparently had trouble recruiting other tenari to their cause since they had a weapons shortage, which this shipment should help solve. The weapons themselves are very concentrated holy water, very difficult to make
        ◦ we’re supposed to meet Prazomal, a Tenari (demon) general, and deliver the cargo to her subordinates
        ◦ first layer of the Abyss is apparently a place of portals
    • A ding goes off in the middle of dinner. All the officers file out of the mess and into the spelljammer’s room. The helmsman says “Captain. We’re slowing. There’s an incoming object.” Captain: “What is she?” Helmsman: “It’s hard to make out. It’s a ship…” a moment passes “Yes. It’s a nightspider”
    • Cpt Cloudsilver calls everyone to quarters. We head to our stations, watching as our ship turns 90 degrees to starboard and the sailors ready themselves for a fight under the sailing master’s commands. The nightspider matches our course, and we can see the craft pursuing us. It’s larger than our ship, and gaining.
    • The captain explains that its a pirate ship, full of spiderlike pirates with eels for heads (neogi). He also tells us not to look into the eyes of the 10ft tall insectoid creatures (umber hulks) that will come with them. Kaz asks what the party should target, the ship or the pirates. The first mate explains that they mean to board our ship, and that we should get to the forecastle and kill them before they can reach us.
    • Combat highlights:
        ◦ Odo rages for the first time!
        ◦ Smutlana casts Moonbeam on the Moonbeam XD
        ◦ Odo knocks a spell-slinging pirate to the lower deck, then drops down blade first and stabs it. Kaz, who’d been hit twice by that mage for counterspelling his first spell, finally gets her revenge by blasting him so hard his head explodes
        ◦ Lana likes to kenku-mimic Kaz’s and Odo’s accents during combat
        ◦ One tlincali almost takes out Mr Basson, an able shipmate. Kaz manages to kill the tlincali and reassure the crewmate, who’s at 2hp
        ◦ The captain was almost singlehandedly taking on tlincali (giant scorpions from Akkeron. these ones are hypnotized and enslaved)
    • Kaz makes sure that Mr Basson is really doing okay (he is, and he’s glad that Kaz and the party were there since that was an especially bad fight for them). Kaz complements him and the crew as well, then breaks out the Alchemy Jug and makes some wine to celebrate. 
        ◦ The first mate says that they normally don’t allow drinking on the job, but given the scale of the battle, he made an exception
    • Lana hears from the first mate that it was almost like the pirates knew where to look for us, since it was highly unusual for them to locate and attack us so close to Marvinia
        ◦ we’d travelled 8 million miles. The spelljammer can travel 100 million miles per day
        ◦ when the ship nears any large object, it automatically slows down. this is why ships can’t escape each other 
    • We pass through the Crystal Sphere boundary as we’re getting ready for bed. Kaz stays out to watch the ship pass through, and sees the world around the ship becomes foggy, before the fog clears up to reveal differently colored points of light on a pearlescent background (the Astral Sea). She’s a little disappointed not to see an actual crystal sphere
    • We go to sleep. In the middle of the night, Nevaeh has a really bad dream about when she found her dad and he disappeared, only this time when he leaves he says “I never really cared about you.” The scene repeats over and over, utterly unnatural.
        ◦ The following morning, Kaz reassures Nev that her dad DID love her, and she’ll find him
    • We head through a swirling amethyst color pool into the Abyss. We find ourselves in stinging hot air. We immediately feel uncomfortable and wrong deep within our souls. The desert beneath us is red and rocky, nothing like the desert from Kaz’s vision on Mount Whrith. A huge swirling column of dust towers over a craggy fortress with a tall spire.
    • We meet the captain at the stern in time to hear him say “Something’s not right. Where are all the defenders on the wall?” As he turns to his first mate to order him to turn around, the dust column dissipates, revealing hundreds of flying fiends shooting toward us


Text RP
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/29/2022
(Can we RP a bit the night after the battle before going to bed? I kinda wanna chat with the crew some and get more info about the baddies we just dealt with. We've bonded now.)
John Dungeon Master — 08/29/2022
(Yeah that’s a good idea)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/29/2022
(Where does everyone gather after something like that on a ship? The mess hall?
I suppose we could also hang out on the deck)
John Dungeon Master — 08/29/2022
(Most of them still have jobs to do, some wounded have been taken below
The captain, 1st mate, and sailing master are on the sterncastle)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/29/2022
(Mess hall
Everyone can see you above deck)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/29/2022
(Yeeessss I wanna hang with my new drinking buddies!)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/29/2022
The mess hall is filled with a tired, but celebratory atmosphere after the battle. Kaz sits on one of the tables, wiping a bit of her own blood off her face as she passes out wine from the alchemy jug. "Oi! We're nearly out, so come get some if ye wanna toast our victory!"
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/29/2022
A rare sight is Smutlana in public unhooded with armor and weaponry fully doffed. He looks more like a sparrow and less like a raven than one might expect of a kenku, based on plumage and beak
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/29/2022
(I love Lana's little naked birb head)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/29/2022
Sparrows are little chonks
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/29/2022
Flawlessly mimicking the gait of a pirate, Lana saunters over to Kaz wearing a dapper but modest tunic and trouser set. Cavalierly, he snatches the mug off the table nearest to her and assumes a Captain Morgan pose
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/29/2022
Nev walks around a few of the tables, giving everyone a once over for injuries and offering some words of encouragement from the Moon Maiden. Eventually making her way to the Captain and first mate. She tries to tidy up her hair and wipe her face again, having stayed pretty clean for most of the fight anyways, she's pretty red now just from trying to wipe off the non-existent dirt/blood. Armor still as shiny clean as Lana's head.  "May I sit? I think my friends will be joining shortly" looks back to see Lana striking a pose on a table
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/29/2022
“Ahoy, ye slaverin' shellbacks an' polywogs alike! give a toast to lady renalia an' 'er dark maiden, lest yer well-intentioned temperance earn 'er moon blessed displeasurrrrrrree…. Arrggghhhhh!!”
But make it a 5’3” kenku
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/29/2022
Kaz laughs, rolling her eyes as she raises her cup. "Aye. An' to a safe remainder of our voyage"
She downs her wine without pausing to breathe
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/29/2022
It's always slightly startling when the mimicry voice takes over and Lana's goes away.
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/29/2022
It very much gives parrot vibes in person
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/30/2022
Lana comically scurries over to Nevaeh as if he has a peg leg and leans over the table, talking to the captain and the first mate but looking mischievously at Nevaeh, “ahoy proud beauty! be that yer shell hardenin on yer back now? Is the wee little green polywog blossoming into a proper shellback oi?!”
John Dungeon Master — 08/30/2022
Captain Cloudsilver says: “everyone please sit, I’m afraid our food has gotten cold. I would ask the cook to warm it for us but she’s seeing to the crew’s meal now” (he doesn’t appear to grasp that Lana is saying something to him) 
(To clarify, you presumably would have returned to your interrupted meal in the officers mess. There’s one large table here. The crew take their meals on the lower deck using tables that consist of boards and sawhorse-like supports that can all be stowed when not in use)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/30/2022
To herself “Hmm yes, I recognize some of those words.”
“If you're asking if I feel better, yes. A little pirate invasion makes you forget about an upset tummy. heh...”
To the captain: “Cold food is better than no food!” She does look a bit dejected but tries to mask it to not seem too frilly for a ship's life.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/30/2022
Kaz hops off the table, blushing a bit as the other officers file in and the atmosphere becomes a bit more stately. "Aye. Still tastes good, and we're still here to eat it"
She proffers the alchemy jug. "Wine, Nev?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/30/2022
“No, thank you...I think my stomach would really hate me for that one later.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/30/2022
Kaz nods, corking the jug. "Oi, Lana, you got any mushrooms fer sea sickness?"
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/30/2022
“Narrrr… but I got some that’ll make you sicker! Hair of the dog and all that.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/30/2022
She thinks for a moment, then shakes her head. "Nah, I don't wanna mix that with wine. Maybe later though"
Her accent is noticeably thicker
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/31/2022
(I love it, slumming it with the pirates everyone chills out, except Nev lol)
"So Captain, May I ask where you're from, originally?"
John Dungeon Master — 08/31/2022
He looks over at you and says: “I’m from a small village near the gate town of Ecstasy in the outlands. My family have lived there for a very long time”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/31/2022
“Oh, Ecstasy. Hm.…” She looks over to Kaz for help “I'm not sure I've heard of it, but I'm not familiar with the Outlands really.” She points to Odo “We're from Waterdeep, er, on Toril.”
John Dungeon Master — 08/31/2022
Mr. Foeslayer says, “ah yes, we’ve put in there many times, a fine city!”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/31/2022
excitedly “Have you ever stopped at the House of the Moon? Maybe I've seen you all come through there before.”
John Dungeon Master — 08/31/2022
Captain Cloudsilver: “we usually remain aboard while in port on prime worlds. One never knows when the ship might be in danger.”
He looks a bit distant as if distracted
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/31/2022
“Are prime worlds very different from each other?” Kaz has her journal out and ready
John Dungeon Master — 08/31/2022
“…what? Oh, yes quite different.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/31/2022
“Oh? How so?” She doesn’t seem to have picked up on his distraction
John Dungeon Master — 08/31/2022
“Well you saw a little of the city of Nosrabet on Karth on our way from Sigil to Marvinia. On Karth, giant lizards called Gota roam the vast steppe lands. Some of them are as big as this ship. The steppe nomads are the only ones who can manage to tame them. So the civilizations across the whole continent are forced to either placate them with tribute or marriage alliances or be trampled into oblivion periodically.”
Foeslayer: “ah yes the Gota. Majestic beasts”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/31/2022
Kaz hums with interest, jotting notes rapidly
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/31/2022
“And I thought marriage purely for political gain was objectionable.
So, did anything exciting ever happen in Ecstasy?”
John Dungeon Master — 08/31/2022
He’s silent for a moment, looking pensive. “No not really”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/01/2022
“Is that why you took to your current uh...way of life? Looking for adventure?”
John Dungeon Master — 09/01/2022
“I could never be at peace with the suffering that exists outside places like Ecstasy. I knew I had to do something actively to assuage  that suffering.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/01/2022
(Does he have anything unusual - relative term - about the way he looks, now that I'm closer?)
John Dungeon Master — 09/01/2022
(Just faintly glowing eyes)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/01/2022
“That's very noble. Ending suffering is why I took my studies so seriously.”
(taking them seriously and being an A grade student are two different things lol). 
Using thaumaturgy she flashes her eyes white to gauge his reaction as she says this
John Dungeon Master — 09/01/2022
He smiles
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/01/2022
Nev inquisitively looks over at the first mate. “Your turn.” She smiles “Where do you hail from originally?”
John Dungeon Master — 09/01/2022
He launches into a lengthy description about Giff mercenary companies and asteroid cities and it becomes clear that has pretty much been on a spell jamming craft since birth
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/01/2022
(Kaz's new best friend)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Yesterday at 10:56 AM
Odo nodding as conversations are happening eating bites of food.
