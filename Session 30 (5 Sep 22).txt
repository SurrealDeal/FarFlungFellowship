    • The officers ask if we should flee for the portal, but the captain says no, because if we flee then the tenari won’t fear death. Everyone looks terrified, since the battle does NOT look survivable
    • Kaz grins and says “Well, they’ve broken their end of the deal, but we can still hold up ours. Let’s give them the weapons they came for – right in their faces”
    • Captain Cloudsilver and First Mate Foeslayer run belowdecks with Odo to collect the concentrated holy water delivery while the rest of the Far Flung Fellowship runs aft to defend the ship until the holy water is ready, and to man the mangonel (a type of catapult) once the holy water is delivered
        ◦ Odo sees a symbol printed on each crate. Inside is a basketball-sized globe of water
    • Some of the Tenari attacking us (mostly a flock of owl-like demons, but a few floating red guys too)


    • One owl-Tenari lands on the ship, gets blasted by magic, flees the battle, and gets chased down for fleeing by one of their fellows
    • behind the rank and file is a Baylor demon, an enormous bull-headed tenari with two weapons, one of which is a flaming whip
    • the crew fights to protect Spelljammer Fi in the sterncastle, so that the ship can still fly. Nevaeh casts Circle of Power and tanks a ton of Fireballs from the red Tenari spellcasters, her spell protecting the crew as well. Odo and Lana move between decks, taking out demons as they go
    • the holy water weapon does 10d10+50 damage!!! It regularly does over 100 damage!!
    • The party realizes that flinging individual holy hand grenades at the tenari won’t get them all, especially since they’ve wised up after the first few blasts and stopped clumping up. Captain Cloudsilver suggests blasting out the bottom of the ship (“you can do that?!” - Kaz, used to regular sailing ships) and letting the holy water rain down on the tenari. Kaz agrees to Shatter the bottom of the ship
    • Nev is nearly knocked out while tanking at one point, but Kaz’s Gift of the Protectors, well, protects her and she stays at 1hp. Kaz feels her journal burn in her pocket as it works and looks up at the ceiling of the hold in a panic
    • TODO: buy more health potions
    • Kaz Shatters the bottom of the ship, letting holy water rain down on the tenari. Most of them are vaporized. The enormous Tenari survives, skin boiling and steaming, and claws his way angrily into the hold with Kaz and Captain Cloudsilver. Faced with a creature of pure evil, Kaz and Captain Cloudsilver can only feel fear and despair. Kaz turns to Cloudsilver and says “Captain. It’s been an honor,” before blasting one of the remaining holy water globe crates at the demon.
    • Odo downs a Potion of Speed and jumps down through several hatches to reach the hold from the upper deck and shoves the demon. It laughs in his face, distracted, as Captain Cloudsilver calls for Spelljammer Fi to tilt the ship forward and slide the rest of the cargo onto the baylor. Some hit, the rest fall out of the hole.
    • Now barely holding itself together, the baylor disappears from the hold. Kaz takes a brief moment to be utterly relieved, then she hears Lana fall unconscious a floor above. She runs upstairs and blasts apart the tenari standing over him.
    • Above, the tenari have finally managed to knock Nev unconscious. Odo bolts upstairs and manages to stabilize her, standing above her to protect her from further attack.
    • We pick off the remaining tenari on the ship. The rest of the flying tenari dip once they see their boss is gone. Captain Cloudsilver orders the ship to limp back through the color pool and into the Astral Sea.
    • With no one who can do more than stabilize them, Nev and Lana remain unconscious for two hours, but finally wake up lying on the top deck along with the rest of the wounded. There’s a big Far Flung Fellowship group hug on deck
    • We head back to the asteroid dock Marvinia. That night, Kaz has horrible nightmares of Asger murdering her father and laughing while she’s powerless to do anything about it. She tries to wake up, sees an aberration hovering above her, and screams
