    • Lana flies to the Sensate Guild and delivers Fredryk the message that we’d like to meet with him the next morning.
    • Gilbert seems to have withdrawn into a brooding trance, and is wondering whether he can show his face in Waterdeep again since he’s been disgraced. Kaz does her best to comfort him and sets up a bed for him to sleep on the ground floor.
    • Kaz casts Contact Other Plane and barely makes the save.
        ◦ Has anyone else recently contacted you the way I have?: No
        ◦ Are you safe?: They seem puzzled by the concept of safe, but respond with “Yes”
        ◦ Do you know of a way to destroy the Conduit?: No
        ◦ Kaz asks to look through the mythallar. It’s still dark of course, but she hears a distant voice that sounds like it could be Asger talking to another snivelling voice (probably Xerfilioc). They’re discussing something technical, but it’s still too muffled to hear (as if a wall is between them and the mythallar)
            ▪ Asger’s probably 
    • Nev casts Commune.
        ◦ Is Gilbert’s remorse true?: Yes
        ◦ Does that mean we can trust the words he spoke tonight?: Yes
        ◦ Is giving Fredryk’s sensate stone to the Watchful Voyagers directly dangerous to Fredryk? Will they go after him?: No 
    • Kaz gets a Sending message from Ganth. “No time for explanation. Very important not to pray to any deities about this information.”
      “What information, specifically?” Kaz replies.
      “Anything regarding the celestial corruption. You never know who could be listening.”
        ◦ Kaz thinks it’s weird that Ganth cast Sending right after Nev cast Commune, but doesn’t see anyone lurking around Nev’s room or outside, and doesn’t see anything unusual with Detect Magic. She puts it down to coincidence.
    • The Far-Flung Fellowship rests for the night. Nev casts Legend Lore on the Nekropoietes staff. It was created by magesmith-slaves in the realm of Thanatos for the champion of Orkus. It was captured in battle and found its way to the horde of the Lord of the Triple Realm (“Graatz”/Grazzt). It’s known to have a strong will of its own.
    • the brooch is a “Brooch of Shielding” and grants resistance to force damage, and immunity to Magic Missile
        ◦ Kaz recalls that Tinkerreach cast Identify on the Conduit when she got it, and learned that it “could be used to contact other plane” which Kaz interpreted as casting the spell “Contact Other Plane”
    • Smutlana creates four giant eagles for the party to fly to the Sensate Guild. It’s a terrifying flight, since the party has not ridden flying creatures before and has no saddles. Odo falls off at one point and his eagle catches him. Fortunately, the party manages to make it to the Sensate Guild unscathed. We’re let in to see “Kyr” and manage to convince him to let one Watchful Voyager in to interview him. Fredryk explains that there are too many people coming and going through the Sensate guild’s inner chambers, and he intends to move to a safer hideout.
    • Kaz moves up to the public area and casts Sending to Ganth to let him know that Fredryk is willing to meet. Ganth responds “Torbold is coming. He’ll be looking like a dwarf. We’re not taking any chances.”
    • Torbold drops the disguise as soon as they’re out of the public areas. He and Kaz make small talk on the way to Fredryk’s room. Torbold says he was last in the Sensate inner sanctum before the Faction War. 
    • Torbold is charming, and quickly puts Fredryk at ease. He explains how he knew Branaris and coaxes Fredryk to talk about how Branaris went missing. He learns generally the same information we did, but also asks about the Shar cultist that Branaris and Fredryk were following and what she sounded like. Fredryk explains that she sounded raspy and wraith-like, and mimics her voice. Kaz recognizes it as the same voice from the Shar cultist with Asger when he captured her dad, and relays that information to the group (“I wouldn’t forget her voice. I wouldn’t forget anythin’ about what I saw that day.”).
    • Fredryk asks us if we think Branaris is still alive. Kaz reassures him that she believes it. Torbold doesn’t say anything, and Kaz gets the sense that he truly doesn’t know.
    • Torbold thanks Fredryk for sharing his story, then asks to meet with us again. Nev says goodbye to Fredryk privately, and learns that he used to be more confident before that fateful last mission.
    • We reconvene with Ganth, who teleports Torbold and the rest of us back to our house. Torbold’s thoughts are back in the Hellgate neighborhood, and the ever-increasing number of very powerful fiends who live there. The Watchful Voyagers believe the nominal boss of that neighborhood is Mirshaz (a pit fiend, a powerful devil). Kaz explains that the last thing the Far-Flung Fellowship was interested in with Hellgate was robbing Ranjat’s hotel room. Lana describes his vision of Ranjat meeting with other fiends. Torbold says that some of those fiends looked like verren (tall, long fingers, pale), which are demons (unlike Ranjat, who’s a devil)
    • The Watchful Voyagers were interested in the Hellgate neighborhood originally because Lord Querial told his agents to avoid the area. They’ve also seen the most Black Rings in the Hellgate neighborhood, which connects Hellgate to the pink building and Branaris’ disappearance.
    • The fiends (especially the yugoloths) have been spreading the idea that there’s a chosen one: the unholy child, a leader who will bring about a new age for them. The idea has been spreading through the demon ranks.
    • The Works – a large building complex near hellgate thought to be the Black Rings’ epicenter. Torbold thinks there’s a link between the Works and Zeletar, with both being bases for the group of fiends. They always travel in well-defended groups which makes it impossible to kidnap one for info.
    • The WV want to find out anything going on in the Works, why they’re located there, whether they’re negotiating with devils, what they’d be negotiating over (to end the blood war?). Ganth suspects that the building (a former manufactory only recently occupied by fiends) was chosen because it has a portal somewhere inside. The spell Warp Sense could let us find the portal, and Ganth produces a scroll for Kaz to copy to her journal (she immediately does so).
        ◦ was added to Planescape, and John has ported it into 5e.
    • Torbold admits that he’s very worried about the building, that he thinks its very well defended, and that there’s a conspiracy at work greater than any of us have considered. He doesn’t want to rush headlong into a deadly trap.
    • Ganth says that they’ve had several operatives very nearly caught by the fiends within feet of the building, likely because there’s some permanent mind-reading spell protecting the building. He suggests using the Catacombs of Undersigil to get close enough to look for portals (and where they lead to) inside the Works.
        ◦ Catacombs include sewers, the Warrens where the Dabus retire to, tombs, refuges, hiding spots, secret markets, and other hidden places.
        ◦ The escape plan is to go straight across the zone, where the WV will meet us. Teleporting directly in is impossible, but we can at least teleport past the bars that separate the Works catacombs from the rest of the city’s catacombs. 
    • Torbold says that he thinks that the corruption of the celestials has spread far enough that it’s no longer safe to communicate sensitive information to the Powers. In fact, he doesn’t think it’s safe to trust a single celestial (since so many, in so many places, have been acting out of sorts). There have also been many wars and calamities striking the planes, and many celestial hierarchies and their powers are focused on the Prime Material. It’s said that the devils intend to launch a campaign of conquest across the Prime Material, though Torbold thinks it’s a pretext to divert everyone’s eyes away from the true goal.
        ◦ Kaz assumes/has heard Lady Renalia say that if devils and demons weren’t fighting, then they’d either invade the Prime Material or the Upper Planes.
    • Lana asks if we should tell Lady Renalia about the situation. Ganth agrees that she could be a powerful ally, and asks if we think we could convince her. Torbold explains that he’d heard about our incident in the Abyss from Lady Renalia in a meeting with Lord Querial, when Querial’s guard captain (their sleeper agent) warned her not to bring up our names to him. He also admits that Eudora (our cook) is one of the Watchful Voyagers’ agents as well.
        ◦ Kaz had no suspicions about her, but is not at all surprised that the Watchful Voyagers were keeping an eye on the party (particularly since they said they’d been keeping an eye on us).
    • Odo brings up the fight we had with the planetar and the Harmonium in Arcadia, and Torbold looks very upset. He mentions that the Harmonium has been acting insane lately, along with many other good-aligned planar groups. The only normal-seeming good organization is the Guardians, who don’t come to Sigil.
        ◦ Chiprick, Lucia, and their group were members of the Guardians. When Ganth brings it up, Kaz realizes how weird it is that Chiprick, a celestial, was encouraging stealing from the Formians.
    • Nevaeh asks how worried she should be about being corrupted herself, as a half-celestial and a person with a direct connection with Selune. Torbold reassures her that aasimar are almost certainly immune to corruption. Also, as far as they know, the powers themselves are still sacrosanct and immune to corruption (though that connection can be snooped on or diverted). As long as she doesn’t bring up any info that would be a red flag to a corrupted celestial in Selune’s service, she should be fine to rely on Selune.
    • We agree to pull off the Works mission the following day. Ganth will bring us directly to the location where the mission is supposed to begin. He also advises against flying on any more giant eagles, as that’s a quick way to become famous.
        ◦ Nev spends the rest of the day praying in the temple, trying to come to terms with not being able to rely on Selune as much. She also casts Sending to Khim to check in and say that she misses her. Khim says that there’s no big news, Odo’s sister is doing well, and that Jesselia (head of the House of the Moon) has been gone a lot recently.
        ◦ Kaz spends the rest of the day copying Warp Sense into her journal.
        ◦ Lana does a mushroom harvest.
        ◦ Odo meets with Jeverin and asks to get in touch with Nezelle (the fiendish woman who Lady Renalia was working with to get the holy water globes to the demons), claiming that he has a crush on her. Jevrin doesn’t know who Nezelle is, but agrees to ask Lanessia to pass Odo’s message along to her.
            ▪ Lanessia comes by our house a few hours later with a sorry-looking Jeverin to ask if Odo is really serious about the love letter. The rest of the party claims he’s mentally disturbed and apologizes to her for the trouble. Kaz gives Jeverin some wine as an apology/fortifying drink.
    • That evening, Nev casts Sending to Fredryk in the evening to wish him well and ensure he’s safe (He says thank you and wishes her well too). She also casts Sending to Cpt Cloudsilver because she’s had an eventful day and wants to hear his voice/warn him to be vigilant (He’s also had an eventful day, and promises to stay vigilant).
    • We dress in shabby clothes and prepare to leave with Ganth. He tells us that Gilbert can’t be allowed to leave, lest he get recaptured now that he knows too much (and praises Kaz for thinking to hide him from divination with the amulet). He also says that the WV are placing a permanent anti-divination spell on our home.
    • Ganth teleports us to a wine cellar. Torbold, Meili, and Boswell are there already. Torbold warns us that the tunnels beneath Hellgate are likely intentionally stocked with creatures so that the fiends don’t trespass into the Dabus’ areas and piss off the Lady of Pain.
        ◦ sometimes the Dabus warrens intersect with the Catacombs and with the sewers (which send excess rainwater to the Plane of Water or the Plane of Ooze)
    • Kaz copies down the map of the catacombs in and around the Works, along with landmarks that appear just before one gets underneath the building and the exit location. Ganth leads us through an empty catacomb to a sewer tunnel with water rushing through a channel beside us. We hear a hideous, inhuman cry in the distance as we follow Ganth through twists and turns, past a huge swarm of cranium rats.
    • We reach the grate covering the tunnels beneath the Works, bid Ganth goodbye, and shapeshift or teleport past the grate with magic. It’s a slog through the tunnels, with Lana navigating the party toward the Works and around threatening creatures. Kaz uses Detect Magic to find magical traps, and Lana uses Find Traps to detect more mundane traps. We cautiously clear each trap, listening for pursuers as we go. Lana convinces some carnivorous mold not to shoot poison spores at us if we stop spraying geysers from Nev’s pitcher to clear traps.
    • We’re getting close to the Works. Just as we’re debating how to get past a Glyph of Warding, a lava slime oozes through the wall towards us.
