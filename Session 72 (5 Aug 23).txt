    • We meet with Torbold and Ganth in the 12th floor meeting chamber as usual. Ganth asks to see the Alethineum, and Nev passes it over. He casts a spell on it, focuses for a moment, then sits back in his chair with a gobsmacked expression, very impressed to be in the presence of the artifact. “I do believe that if anything could work, this should do it.” 
    • Kaz suggests that we use the rod to cure Lord Querial as soon as possible, since the Vigilant Sentinels are both one of our greatest threats at the moment, and a potentially great ally. Lana wants to test that the Alethineum works fast enough that curing madness wouldn’t be a problem mid-battle. Torbold doesn’t think we’ll be able to reach Lord Querial, so we put our heads together to find another corrupted celestial to test. Torbold points out that, if our enemies know we’ve gotten the Alethineum, they’ll send more corrupted celestials to investigate the Temple of Clarity. He goes to make arrangements for WV operatives to scope it out and potentially capture one for us to try to cure.
    • Torbold suggests a demiplane-wide party to celebrate our big win, and to cheer people up given all the morose feelings. We excitedly agree, and decide to hold it the following evening, the 28th of Uktar.
        ◦ The Hallowing of Selune, a very important holy day for Selune, is the 30th. The Feast of the Moon (a civic holiday where people remember the dead, far less important holiday to Selune)
    • Kaz attunes to the Alethineum to avoid madness, then casts Contact Other Plane
        ◦ Do you have days and nights where you are?: Mental search until they kind of understand what days and nights are. “No”
        ◦ Do you have magic where you are?: Mental search for magic. The response is along the lines of “Maybe/I think so/kind of.” 
        ◦ Can you still not see the mythallar?: “No, dark.”
        ◦ Kaz spends the rest of her time telling them about her day and helping them to understand her world. She knows from her research into warlock pacts that her patron is vastly different from other warlock patrons, and is glad that Exilicor wants to communicate even though it’s difficult.
    • Nev casts Commune and asks if the Captain is safe where he is, how her friends are doing, and how her mom’s soul is doing. She knows that it’s entirely possible that her Commune is being listened to by her enemies, and doesn’t want to give away any dangerous information. She  casts Sending to Khim, and learns that she and Tammy are doing fine and everyone is preparing for the Hallowing. She also casts Sending to the Captain and tells him when we’ll be in Waterdeep for the Hallowing and that we’ll have good news. He replies that the crew is nearly done with repairs and that he’d like to link up with us when possible to help with our cause.
    • Lana eats several of her magic mushrooms to gain new magical spells, aided by her Rhizomorph staff. She also communes with her symbiont.
    • Odo spends the evening with his family and introduces Valentina to his sister Bobbi. It takes him quite a long time to find Valentina, but with Smutlana’s help he finally encounters her perched on the corner of one of the rooftop garden farms and convinces her to come with him. He finds Bobbi much more easily, facing the outside of Brin’s Haven’s “shell” and poking at it. “Hi Odo. This place, I don’t like it. It’s a prison” Odo joins her, commiserating that it does feel like a prison sometimes, but he’s glad she’s safe. She asks how long they’ll have to stay in Brin’s Haven, and he reassures her that it shouldn’t be too long. She’s very impressed that a tressym has chosen to stay with us, and petting Valentina lifts her mood.
        ◦ Odo looks across Brin’s Haven and sees that Lori is spending time with Ned, a human teenager. As far as Bobbi knows, Ned’s father is someone high-ranking in the WV. There’s clearly some flirting happening. Lana advises Odo “as a druid” to “let nature take its course” rather than going over to introduce himself.
    • The 28th of Uktar arrives. Kaz’s friends Lorelei and Rhyleigh are doing some training to get involved with the Watchful Voyagers. Angela is out on her own mission. Erudir is fully focused on entertaining the people of Brin’s Haven, and is practicing for the party in the evening. Kaz herself goes around helping people prepare for the party.
    • The party spills out from the Laughing Minstrel onto the central courtyard. Torbold gets up and makes a toast to the crowd, and gives a very charismatic speech. Odo runs security detail, unable to fully believe that this party won’t go wrong. Lana, after a healthy amount of mead, has fun turning groups of willing people into animals. Rhyleigh gets very into it, along with a large fraction of everyone else at the party. Johar the mage is at the ready to cast Featherfall if anyone flies into the wall as a bird and turns back into a human. Erudir, Marcella, and Leehan are playing raucuous folk music. Nev dances with Bobbi. Kaz hangs out with her friends, tries out the animal shapes, and spends some time dancing. Overall the party is a smashing success and winds down as families put their kids to bed.
    • As people are sitting in the tavern after the party, a bell rings. Leehan stops playing, says “uh oh” and runs off. We run after him downstairs and find several Watchful Voyagers very badly injured, having just returned from a mission. We learn that Sten was eaten in Hades. Asim died as well, but his body was returned and he is revived. Annen clutches her hair and stares down at Asim, blood on her face. She explains that they got attacked by hoardlings.
        ◦ Hoardlings are neither demons nor devils (neutral evil). No two look alike. They go around doing evil and are native to Hades.
        ◦ There’s a funeral for Sten the following day, which we attend. There’s a fresh pall over some of the Watchful Voyagers.
    • The next day, after Sten’s funeral, we’re summoned to meet with Torbold. We recognize Dash (Dashwin) Fitztimmons as Ned’s father. Torbold explains that the fiends that killed Sten nearly got the Brin’s Haven tuning fork, and he’s no longer comfortable with using Brin’s Haven as a base of operations when there are so many civilians present. Kaz suggests that we use the Starglimmer as a new base of operations, since it moves around the Astral Plane and is protected from divination magic. Torbold agrees, and adds that the Watchful Voyager’s own fleet could also host operatives as part of a moving base. Ganth says he’ll have to stay in Brin’s Haven, rather than going out into the field, so he doesn’t magically overexert himself again.
        ◦ Captain Cloudsilver thinks its a great idea, and offers to rendezvous with the Watchful Voyager’s fleet near the Shrouded Psiclone in the Astral Plane
    • We rest for the evening, then Planeshift to Waterdeep to see the paladin investiture (aka Tammy’s graduation) and the Hallowing of Selune. The House of the Moon is surrounded by pilgrims and Selunite clerics in their sea blue robes. Khim is directing traffic, and we head to the Chapel of the Full Moon on the third floor. We see Tammy in her blue robes, waiting to be inducted into the Order of the Half Moon. She’s very happy to see Odo and Nev.
        ◦ Nev wears her vestaments. Kaz wears the same diaphanous blue gown she once wore to dinner on the Starglimmer. Lana disguises her armor beneath pilgrim’s clothes and hides her more fungal features under her clothes and a hat. Odo takes a shower and wears his fine clothes over his mithril armor, looking like a proper young Falcanspur noble.
    • The training leader, Mistress Nadia, opens up the ceremony with a speech, and introduces the new recruits. Then Jesselia Reddenthorp comes to the stage, leads everyone in a brief prayer, and instructs the recruits in how to take their oath. The recruits then put a blue mantle around their necks and affix a half moon blade to the ends of their moon poles. The ceremony concludes, and the new recruits immediately walk out a side door as the guests file out.
    • We find Tammy in the grand hall and congratulate her. She’s clearly put on some muscle throughout her training, and she chit-chats with the group for a little while. Odo passes on his parents’ congratulations, since we didn’t want to bring them to Waterdeep and risk their safety (and we, the players, didn’t think to bring them with us). Tammy talks to us about her training and the various priestesses she’s met, introduces us to her close friend and fellow graduate Leonart “Leo” Pickridge, and shares a little gossip with us. She bids us goodbye.
    • Sora Hallowfil comes up to us and says hello to Nev. She invites her to participate in a Mass Ceremony of the Mystery of the Night, a ceremony performed by all Selunite clergy once a year. It involves burning incense and going into a meditative state, which allows them to fly into the sky and Commune with Selune when the moon is at its zenith. It’s a very secret ceremony, open only to Selunite priestesses, and it’s a new experience for Nev.
    • We have a few hours to kill before the Hallowing procession. Lana wants to try to buy a Superior healing potion, so we spend several fruitless hours searching for one. As we walk through the city, we see Emony Applehill, her husband, and her son Daniel. We spend a few minutes catching up with them, and learn that their lives have been mostly peaceful since they escaped Fort Gilbert. 
    • We head back to the House of the Moon to join the procession. Up in the grand balcony overlooking the north entrance are Jesselia in her full high priestess regalia with the rest of the high clergy, all of whom are dressed opulently. The moment the moon rises, Jesselia yells “She is risen!” The musicians begin to play, the choir sings a hymn, and the high clergy walk downstairs to lead the procession. We wait a while until we’re able to follow the rest of the crowd. The clergy are all singing the Litany of the Shards, which invokes the names of all of Selune’s Shards. Jesselia reaches the sea and performs a ceremony we can’t really see or hear from our position, then turns around and guides the procession back to the House of the Moon.
        ◦ Kaz whispers a little prayer to herself as she walks, thanking Selune for watching over the party and keeping them safe.
    • It’s dark by the time we reach the House of the Moon again, and its nearly time for Nev to go with her fellow priestesses. The rest of the party decides to follow the priestesses to the edge of the city, pick a tavern, and hang out as close to Nev as is reasonable. We wait outside the House of the Moon for everyone to leave. 
    • Inside, Nev accompanies Sora to see Jesselia, who wants to speak with her. Jesselia’s private study is on the 4th floor. Some of the other high clergy are there, and have taken off some of their excess regalia after such a long procession. Nev says hello to everyone. Jesselia looks to the other clergy and says “Well, do it.” All six cast Hold Person at her, but she succeeds on six wisdom saves. Jesselia looks absolutely shocked, then casts Power Word Stun at Nev and stuns her. Sora puts a collar on her that blocks her from her magical abilities.
    • Jesselia: “You heretic! You betrayer of the faith! You will be punished for your crimes. At dawn, you shall be executed. Bring her to the cell.” The rest of the clergy are shaking a bit. One of the priestesses, Irene, says “High priestess, is she not entitled to a tribunal of the faith?” Jesselia replies, “As I have told you, I am in direct contact with Megariana, chieftess of the Shards, and she has commanded this.”
        ◦ Megariana is a celestial.
    • The clergy remove all of Nev’s weapons and magical items, including her Moonlight Pendant, and cuffs her hands behind her back. Nev comes out of the stun after a minute, and cries out “Why? What did I do? What’s going on?” Jesselia replies “I don’t have to explain myself to a heretic and a traitor.” Nev professes her innocence, but Jesselia refuses to listen. The other priestesses look at Jesselia, unnerved by the whole situation. Jesselia sees their hesitance and yells “Do you challenge me? Do you challenge Megariana?” and they back down.
    • The high clergy walk Nev through a group of assembled clergy on the third level, past the Chapel of Hidden Truths, where Selune’s avatar was imprisoned during the Time of Troubles by Shar, and into a monastic cell. They lock the door behind her. Nev stands inside, stunned, then snaps out of it and starts searching the room. There’s a bucket, a chair, and a bed with one blanket on it. Outside, the throng of clergy are leaving for the Mass Ceremony of the Mystery of the Night.
    • Meanwhile, the party is hanging out in a nearby tavern. We see a huge throng of clerics leaving toward the North Gate, heading for the ceremony, but we can’t pick Nev out of the masses. We stay at the tavern for a bit, then head back to Nev’s house to sleep until the clerics return in the morning.
    • Several hours pass. Nev goes to the door of her cell and starts speaking, hoping that someone is listening outside, and begs them to believe that she’s innocent and devoted to Selune. At about 1am, she hears a faint knock at the door. She taps back, and the door is unlocked. Tammy steps into the room, looks at Nev, and her jaw drops. She steps into the room and shuts the door behind her, then explains that she stole the key and that she’s busting Nev out. She unlocks Nev’s cuffs, but can’t quite get the collar off. Unable to get Nev past the guards, she goes to get the rest of the party.
    • Kaz wakes up to Tammy throwing a rock at her window (technically Nev’s, since she’s staying in Nev’s room). She goes downstairs to let Tammy in, and is shocked to hear that Nev’s been imprisoned. She wakes up the others, and we all discuss how to rescue Nev and get her things back (which includes the Alethineum). The plan is to sneak into the House of the Moon through an abandoned sewer tunnel, then slip through a secret passage into the crypt. Then, Lana will cast Animal Shapes on the party and Tammy will carry us past the few guards that remain.
    • As we walk through the crypt, we see a huge floor-to-ceiling mirror. Tammy says it’s weird that the mirror is in the crypt, since it’s normally on the second floor. Kaz can only think that there’s some strange Selune-related reason to put a mirror down here. We agree to keep moving and get Nev.
    • Lana turns us into mice and we hide in Tammy’s pocket. She’s briefly caught by a higher-ranking member of her order, but then sent upstairs to bed. She reaches Nev’s cell, but just as she pulls out the key to Nev’s cell, Leo comes around the corner. Tammy lies and says she’s not doing anything, and pretends that she didn’t know there was a “dangerous prisoner” inside the cell. Leo leaves, and Tammy lets us into the cell. Nev’s clearly been crying, but is relieved to see us. Kaz uses her corrosive potion from Ganth to break off Nev’s collar and gives her a big hug.
        ◦ Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/05/2023 11:46 PM
          At some point during my putting on my armor and grabbing my things, I would have told Tammy "I got you a present, but now I have to get you a better one." lol cuz she saved my ASS
        ◦ Kaz asks Nev about the mirror. Nev explains that the mirror is the Sojourner’s Portal, a mirror that can transport you to various different places, including the Gates of the Moon (Selune’s divine domain). She also knows it’s completely weird that it’s down in the crypt, and that Jesselia is the one who controls access to the mirror.
    • All four of us turn back into mice and slip into Tammy’s pocket. Tammy tries to bring us up to Jesselia’s office, but there’s another older paladin guarding the door. Kaz reverts to human form and casts Banishment on the guard. We swiftly cross the hall and enter Jesselia’s room. Nev immediately puts on her Moonlight Pendant and her automatic breastplate. The clerics took back the reliquary they loaned Nev
    • Kaz immediately searches the office, though she quickly realizes it’s more of a formal office than a real workplace where secrets might be hidden. In the center of the room is a 20ft wide marble table which dominates the room. There are bookcases with various religious texts around the walls. Kaz finds letters explaining, in ecclesiastical terms, why Nev is being executed. It boils down to “by command of the goddess” even though priests are normally immune from being executed, and accuses Nev of using dark powers to shield her activity from scrying and travelling to the lower planes to worship evil deities.
        ◦ Nev being unscryable could only have been conferred by a deity, hence the accusation of worshipping evil gods.
    • We feel and hear something shake the building below us, as if something impacted the foundations in the crypt. We hear shouts of “We’re under attack!” and bloodcurdling screams for help coming from below. Odo mimes in Kenku hand signs that the attack has come from below, but only Lana understands it. Nev knows that attacking a Selune temple from below is a Shar cultist move.
    • Nev gives a passionate argument that we should fight to defend the innocent Selunite clerics and paladins in the House of the Moon, rather than fleeing as Lana suggests. Lana capitulates and turns the party into birds. We fly back down and into the crypt. There is a large hole in the crypt floor, and Shar cultists are climbing up from the sewers and into the room. The Sojourner’s Portal is glowing and is projecting a large circular portal. The large procession of Shar cultists are entering the portal holding black rods – the same black rods from the Chasm of Utmo. Several Order of the Half Moon paladins are trying to block them from entering the portal, but many are being slain where they stand by the elite cultists. Nev just sees Excrecera step through the portal and disappear from the room.
