    • Kaz convinces Gersh to tell the Far Flung Fellowship where the fungus demon lady and Asger are. Gersh pulls out another vellum scroll (probably the skin of some humanoid) from his scroll case. It appears to be some kind of crudely drawn map of portals to lairs in Carceri. Kaz frantically copies it all down into her notebook.
        ◦ There’s a sequence of portals one can take to get down to the lower lairs of Carceri.
        ◦ “They have gone to Agathys, the lowest level of Carceri. It is very cold there.” Gersh doesn’t know where they are specifically.
    • Odo asks if Gersh knows of any weaknesses that the fungal lady has. He doesn’t.
    • Gersh takes back the vellum scroll, puts it back in the metal cylinder, tosses the cylinder into a pouch of his cheek, and dives into an Outlands swamp with a parting “Never come before me again!”
    • Lana flies up as a shoebill to look for the nearest town, but only sees a distant trail.
    • Nevaeh scrapes a bit of gray-tan Curst dust off of Odo and uses Selune’s gift to cast Find the Path. She learns that Curst is about a day’s ride away from the party. Lana recalls seeing a caravan travelling toward Curst as we left to meet Gersh, so we ride out on Mushmares to meet them and barter passage to Curst.
        ◦ the mushmares only last 1 hr.
    • The casta lizardfolk are reluctant to take us on, but between Kaz’s gold and Lana’s mushcakes, the party manages to convince them to let us ride along for the day until we reach Curst. On the way back, the Far Flung Fellowship discuss what to do about the fungal demon lady and the Mythallar.
        ◦ We realize that we can use the Conduit to cast Find the Path to the mythallar, since they were both in the same place at the same time in Agathys.
        ◦ We also realize that we should probably avoid the demon fungal lady.
        ◦ We sleep most of the journey and wake up in the morning of Eliasus 26
    • We head to Tinkerreach to convince her to give us the mirror. She’s shocked to hear we’re heading to Agathys, and asks “Kasma” why she’d bring her friends to “certain suicide.” Kaz lists a bunch of the threats she knows about on Agathys (which isn’t a lot, since VERY few people go there and survive) and concludes by saying “So yes, we do know what we’re up against.”
    • Kaz explains that there’s a mythallar on Agathys and that Asger is after it. Reluctantly, Tinkerreach agrees to help. She goes downstairs for a bit, then comes back up with a lead case. Inside is the hand mirror. As soon as Kaz touches the mirror, there’s a spark of static electricity and her hair frizzes out.
        ◦ Studying the mirror again, Kaz looks at the decorative motif on the back and thinks that the molding looks like greenery.
    • Tinkerreach says “Kasma? Be safe” and gives Kaz a potion of greater healing.
    • We get back to Sigil, then immediately portal from a border town (“Town with no name” in infernal) to Othrys (first level of Carceri with giant insects and the smell of rot) to Porphytes (layer above Agathys, an endless shallow ocean of acid water constantly replenished by black snow)
    • The portal to Porphytes leads to a small cave on a sandbar. We see a bunch of penitents huddled on the sandbar with us, horribly burned by the acid and trying to avoid the ocean. Acid rain drips down on our heads, but we’re protected from the worst of the sting by our planar adaptation necklaces. The portal to Agathys is 200-300ft away, across the ocean.
    • Nev and Lana fly across the ocean, while Kaz Dimension Doors herself and Odo to the opposite island. The Agathys portal is a giant hole in the ground, with seawater pouring over the edges. The acid hurts as the party jumps into the portal, feeling the whoosh as the portal wraps around us.
    • We land hard, but not as hard as we’d expect. The entire sky is dark, and the only light comes from vaguely luminescent mist. Our entire surroundings are creaking, blackened, cracked ice, with only the occasional hunched penitent moaning and wandering in the distance.
        ◦ Smutlana realizes that the ice’s groaning is mostly exaggerated, and that the ice only seems to crack if one stays still.
    • Nevaeh casts Find the Path, the mirror glowing as she does so. She learns that its origin on Agathys is about 50 miles away. Lana summons sporses (mush mares) and the Far Flung Fellowship rides out towards the mythallar.
    • We ride for 8hr, about 2/3rds of the total distance. Just as we’re reaching our limit, we start coming across 50ft deep pits spaced in what looks like a grid search, with mounds of excavated ice piled beside them. We’ve reached the excavation site.
    • The ice beneath us cracks more slowly on top of the excavation piles, so we set up camp atop one, with a rotating watch to make sure nobody sinks into the ice.
        ◦ Nevaeh casts Leomund’s Tiny Hut to keep us safe. Even so, it’s hard to sleep on top of insideous evil ice that constantly cracks beneath us.
    • We set out again. Smutlana casts Pass Without a Trace on the party. As we travel, we see a faint glow in the distance ahead and to the right of us. Smutlana wildshapes into an owl and goes to investigate, with Nevaeh giving her (and the rest of the party) 300ft of darkvision with Eyes of Night. She flies about 15 miles and sees that the light is comprised of many lightsources, held by fungal demons moving around down below and excavating the ice.
        ◦ we recall that the original Uvorin Decemvirate complex had fungal demons inside as well
    • Lana catches up with the rest of the party as they continue moving forward. As we get closer to the mythallar, we can tell by the amount of new snow filling the pits that we’re passing older and older excavation pits. It seems as though the fungal demon is heading in the wrong direction. We very seldom see petitioners now, as if there are fewer than there were before.
    • Nevaeh comes to the end of the Path, which is a spot that looks like any other. Everyone assumes that the mythallar is buried. Lana tries to cast Locate Object, but can’t detect anything, so we assume that we’ve been led to the mirror’s origin, and that the mirror’s path diverged from the mythallar’s from here. She concentrates on Locate Object, flies out to keep searching, and realizes that the oldest pits are centered around us, with newer pits spiralling outward all around.
    • Kaz points out that her vision of dust falling onto the mythallar from above had only happened a few days ago, so the mythallar must be near one of the inner pits. She does some mental math and estimates that the mythallar must be in one of the inner rings (as if the fungal demon had just missed it). Lana flies around the rough area and uses Locate Object to find the mythallar beneath the ice directly between four pits.
    • Lana notices a frozen petitioner watching us, more than one would expect from a petitioner in agonizing pain. Creeped out, she tries to whack them with her staff, only for them to suddenly disappear into a crack. Kaz comes up to see what’s going on, and both examine the hole. Kaz can’t sense the petitioner’s thoughts within 30ft, but Lana gets wise, touches the ice with her staff, and realizes its an illusion.
    • Nev puts her face through the illusion and sees a tunnel leading 150ft down, with handholds carved into the walls. Kaz casts Alarm on the entryway, and we all stealthily descend into an enormous empty room carved out of ice, with a 10ft high ceiling.
    • No one can see or hear anything, but Kaz can just smell some type of creature. Nev casts See Invisibility and sees four invisible creatures standing against the back wall, watching us. Realizing they’ve been spotted, they screech and attack
        ◦ we’ve seen these creatures in Sigil, as wizard servants (ASGER). They’re slaadi, native to Limbo (we happened to be distant from their epicenter when we were in Limbo)
    • Death Ward active on Kaz (lasts 8 hr)
        ◦ The first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the spell ends. 
        ◦ If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell ends.
    • when the slaad die, they turn to disjoint lumps of masonry stone that fall into a pile
        ◦ Kaz has never heard of slaad turning to stone like that, so she thinks it’s weird
    • We kill two. The other two disengage and dive through a seemingly normal patch of the wall, and the party gives chase.
    • Hex active (last 8 hr)
