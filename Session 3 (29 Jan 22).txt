Travelling to Dankseep Colony
    • zuggtboy asks if the myconid has seen any humanoids recently. they have recently seen another surface dweller. he is at their colony of Dankseep, alive. Kaz asks how sporeservants are made, myconid explains that they’re resurrected dead bodies brought back to life by sporeservants
    • We wander down passages, see a huge monster with blades attached to its arm, we see it’s another spore servant

    • Zuggtboy asks about all the blackened fungus on the wall. We learn that the dead fungus was part of Aramakos, but died off after the failed wedding attempt. The bride (whom we’ll learn about in the colony) was unable to marry the groom (Aramakos).
    • Colony is a vast open space with terraces along the sides. Mushroom groves, gardens, myconids everywhere, bioluminescence. In the center is an ENORMOUS mushroom 2 stories tall. One myconid is much taller than the others. All myconids are moving oddly, almost dancing, strangly happy. Zuggtboy distantly smells the same evil fungus smell from the monster that attacked us.

Relations Decay
    • Sovereign Rusilia is the tall one. Zuggtboy asks her what the deal is with the demon mushroom smell, she looks happy and says he’ll “understand soon”. She reaches out to touch the party, Kaz shies away. “Perhaps you should hear it from one of your own. You will hear from Amwyn, one of our newest converts, about the joyous lady of decay.” 
    • we see a human completely covered in fungus, body strangely bloated, stoming toward us. Odo recognizes Amwyn as one of the missing townsfolk, to his horror.
    • Sovereign Rusilia shouts “Show them the true glory of Zuggtmoy!” as Amwyn SPRINTS forward. The rest of the mushroom folk part to let Amwyn through, then close around the fight in a circle. They start chanting“Zuggtmoy!” and continue waving their arms, still excited to welcome the party into the fold.
    • The Amwyn monster tears a chunk of fungus off its body and hurls it at Zuggtboy. It burns like acid, like pepper spray. The mushrooms on the corpse can heal it.
    • Zuggtboy conjures a nature spirit to heal us. it looks like a little mushroom with a halo.
    • Kaz gets the killing blow, an enormous eldritch blast blowing Amwyn’s corpse apart and sending his remains flying across the cavern

Fleeing Dankseep Colony
    • Sovereign Rusilia says “You have transgressed against the Lady of Decay. You must be shown the way by force!” all 100+ myconids start rushing toward us. We flee. Sovereign Rusilia attacks Kaz with hallucination spores as she runs away, but Kaz manages to shake it off. (apparently if Rusilia had succeeded, it would’ve been real bad for the party)
    • We run through a large cavern, Kaz trips on some mushrooms on the ground. she manages to get up and run just in time to avoid the myconids catching up, but they’re right on her heels.
    • The party runs into a narrow tunnel, single file. We know that there’s a boulder above the path which can be dropped to seal off Dankseep colony.
    • We hear a new voice in our mind from the Rapport Spores, saying “quick, this way!” we get the intuitive sense that it’s from further up in the direction we’re running. over to the side of the chamber, we see a little myconid on all fours (child) beckoning to us beside a crack in the wall we could all fit through
    • we try to push the boulder down, fail. Sovereign Rusilia tries to get Zuggtboy with hallucination spores, but he shakes it off. all other myconids are bottlenecked behind Sovereign Rusilia.
    • Kaz and Lyesgiel rush and crawl through the crack. Zuggtboy takes a moment to attack Rusilia before he too runs for the crack.
    • Odo looks Rusilia dead in the eyes, says “I don’t got mushroom for error, I reckon” and uses his crowbar to roll the boulder directly onto Rusilia, crushing her. The myconids behind her are trying to squeeze through the crack. Odo follows everyone else into the crack

New Dankseep Colony
    • the crack eventually opens up to the point we can run. “that was a close one. they were infected” says the little myconid
    • the little myconid offers to take them to its colony, new Dankseep, led by Sovereign Panaleas. Kaz is sus from the prior myconid colony so she vibe checks them, can tell that the little myconid is acting differently than the others, and she suspects that this one is the honest one. She uses her telepathy to let the others know that she thinks this one is trustworthy. Odo responds aloud, and she warns him that he probably shouldn’t let people know that he’s responding to a voice in his head. He gives her a thumbs up
    • the journey to new Dankseep takes several hours. we meet Panaleas, who remarks that “I imagine [Sovereign Rusilia] won’t stay smashed for long. Myconid sovereigns are quite hardy.”
    • none of these myconids are dancing. we gather that myconids generally stand as still as possible, no extra movement
    • All the myconids were part of dankseep until several cycles ago when “the dark times came” and the others began to turn. The unaffected fled to form a new colony. They can’t flee too far because they can’t leave the sacred grove unattended, which is a sacred place of Psilofyr. Panaleas and Zuggtboy bond over both being followers of Psilofyr
    • Lyesgiel detects that we’ve gotten farther away from whatever portal he’d felt earlier, and that he didn’t feel one nearby, so the sacred grove isn’t a portal.
    • Panaleus mentions that a group of drow are camped in the great forest as an incursion. He doesn’t know why they’re there, but it doesn’t seem to be for the myconids.
        ◦ the great forest is a Zirkwood forest (50 foot tall mushrooms, wooden trunks)
    • Zuggtboy explains that he ate a mushroom while under the thrall of a rakshasa & made contact with Psilofyr, gained power to speak. It inspired him to run away from the rakshasa, he fell in with the lizardfolk, and learned more about Psilofyr.
    • Myconids have a strict vow of peace in accordance with following Psilofyr’s teachings. They don’t attack people, only reanimate dead matter

The Demon
    • We see the sacred grove up ahead, full of multicolored bioluminescent light. Its a beautiful garden, the mushrooms look amazing. Zuggtboy hears a voice in his head saying “No! No! No! Don’t go in there!” Zuggtboy stops outside the cavern, tries to commune with Psilofyr to see what’s going on. All he hears is “Stay out of that cavern!”
    • Zuggtboy knows Kaz can speak inside his head, asks her if she can look inside his head to see what’s going on. Odo distracts the Myconids with an armpit fart performance. They’re baffled.
    • Kaz casts Detect Thoughts. Myconids back in the colony are thinking “gather spores, gather spores” Panaleas: “this is a strange thing that this surface creature is doing with his arm”
    • Kaz tries to delve deeper, gets extreme distress from Zuggtboy because something is going wrong. Zuggtboy hears a voice telling him to stop her from delving deeper, and to kill Kaz and everyone else. Zuggtboy tells Kaz what’s going on, she encourages him to go into the grove, and maybe the real Psilofyr will be able to help him
    • Zuggtboy stumbles toward the grove, ignoring the voice screaming in his head. once he crosses the threshold, he’s wracked with pain and falls to his knees. he vomits up green slime that forms a face and writhes on the ground, unable to cross the threshold with him.
    • Kaz uses her dark shard amulet to cast Create Bonfire, burning the writhing slime. Odo uses the bonfire to light one of his torches, panicking the myconids who don’t want fire in the sacred grove.
    • The slime writhes out of the bonfire, forming a pillar with an angry face in the hallway leading to the grove “Fools! Now you must all die!” To Zuggtboy it says “You! You could have been great, if you’d just followed my instructions” It begins to retreat down the hallway, and Zuggtboy yells at us to follow after it.
    • Odo runs after it, putting out his torch in the slime creature. He draws his longsword, surging forward and driving the blade into the thing. It seems resistant to the fire and to his sword.
    • Kaz blasts it a couple times. Lyesgiel tries to jump over Odo and the slime creature, falls into the slime creature but manages to tumble over and stand up on the other side. He turns, casts primeval awareness, and realizes that the slime is a fiend. He also detects aberrations and a dragon (or multiple dragons) within a mile.
    • The slime creature says “Wait wait wait, let’s talk. Put away your weapons, or we can fight it out to your deaths”
    • Kaz casts Detect Thoughts, its thoughts are disturbing and chaotic and fragmented. “What were you doing in my friend?” she asks
    • The demon responds “I was a servant of the faceless lord sent to spy on Zuggtboy’s former master Ranjat dor'alkaba, so I possessed your friend. Then he ran away, so I did the next best thing and I focused on telling him to kill my arch enemy zuggtmoi. How long I’ve spent in the slime pits doing battle against the demon queen’s fungal minions” Kaz senses rage against the demon queen of fungi, but it seems to be telling the truth
    • Zuggtmoi knows he wasn’t possessed forever, so he asks when it possessed him. It just laughs and turns into a mushroom, implying that Zuggtboy ate him at some point and got possessed.
    • Kaz cries out “who is the faceless lord?” and it morphs back into a slime column to respond “Juiblex is the faceless lord, sweet be his name”. None of the party seems to recognize the abyssal name.
    • Kaz asks what the demon would do if allowed to leave. It says it would hunt down Zuggtmoy’s servants, including those in the original Dankseep colony. Kaz is ruthless enough to consider it, but the other myconids cry out that they wish to heal their bretherin, and that’s all it takes to convince her to kill the demon instead.
    • We go back to fighting the thing. Kaz eventually blows it apart, its remnants sizzling on the cave walls. As he dies, he cries out “I return to Shadakla to battle the demon queen”

The Sacred Grove
    • We explain to the myconids that Zuggtboy was possessed, they let us into the sacred garden. Everything is perfectly arranged, at the back is the mushroom version of a 1000 year old bonsai tree. Rainbow glow, gnarled and twisted flesh. It’s beautiful. Zuggtboy kneels down by the mushroom, a burst of rainbow spores comes out, Zuggtboy flashes through the past year of his life, then has a vision of an unfathomably vast realm full of mushrooms. Enormous gears in the background. He sees an enormous mushroom which says to him “come to me in Mycelia” and the vision fades.
    • Kaz recognizes the gears as something that sounds like Mechanus, lawful neutral plane. She relays that Psilofyr might be one of the deities residing on Mechanus.
    • Odo is doing nothing but make mushroom puns throughout the fight and the time afterwards.
    • Odo asks if the myconids have seen any of the other surface dwellers, Panaleas says that one of their scouts saw that the drow captured a surface dweller as a slave. About 13 drow, some spiders, quaggoth, and lizards. She offers to help guide us to the drow and their prisoner, we are grateful and knowing that they requested help earlier, ask what they need help with.
    • The myconids have concocted a plan to free their bretherin from Zuggtmoy. the giant mushroom in the center of the original colony might be able to heal the infected if we can stab it with a mushroom spine containing a potion of spores from the sacred grove. We agree to help.
    • we take a long rest. they give us blue spore bread (since surfacers need food), which is quite tasty. 
    • Lyesgiel is ready to open up, tells us the story of what happened to him. His friends and he were travelling through the high forest. Evil wizard and his thugs surrounded them, paralyzed Lyesgiel and kidnapped him to find a portal. His friends surrendered, but the wizard burned them to death anyway. He eventually managed to escape. 
        ◦ The portal he sensed was near where we first came down into the mine. Lyesgiel doesn’t know where it leads, but wants to take whatever treasure it contains so that the wizard can’t have it.
