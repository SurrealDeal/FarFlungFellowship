    • It’s Marpenoth 5
    • Kaz gives the party a tour of her home. She makes sure her dad will keep wearing the amulet of proof against detection and location, which he agrees. She also asks him (and a few other elves) if he’s heard of any elvish ruins associated with silver hand mirrors, but he has not.
    • Kaz takes her friends to the Distinguished Adventurer’s Clubhouse, a hollow tree near a bend in the river not far from Torthyr. There are a few wooden toys left behind, and rocks arranged in deliberate-but-mysterious patterns. Kaz remarks that it felt larger when she was smaller. To induct the rest of the party into the club with Lorelei and Rhyleigh, she asks them to present an item they’ve found on their adventures and tell the group how they found it (she explains that she came up with the ritual as a kid, and sheepishly admits that she’d like to hear their stories again even though she was present for most of them)
        ◦ Kaz explains that her original entry item was a toy lute that the rest of the party saw in her bedroom. Her dad had given it to her when she was young and accompanied him on one of his tours (she was usualy the one passing around the hat for tips at his performances, but sometimes she’d pretend to play the lute with him)
        ◦ Lana presents “this funny little stick” and holds up her staff. She got it from killing Neogi (eel spider people) pirates in Wildspace.
        ◦ Nev pulls out the limbo globe. “We got this when we were in Limbo and floating around on a giant one of those”
        ◦ “I think one of the most fantastic puzzles we dealt with was when we got this thing” Odo says as he pulls out the Ice Javelin. He asks if he has to leave the javelin in the grotto with the other toys, but Kaz reassures him he doesn’t. He’s relieved that he doesn’t have to pay dues, and Kaz jokes that he’s getting “the friend discount”
    • Kaz escorts Lana to a nearby druidic shrine, with a totem in an ancient tree. It’s a very intentional, but natural enclosure, and it feels welcoming for creatures to enter and congregate. Smutlana Communes With Nature as part of her druidic rites in the space, and learns that:
        ◦ there are no powerful celestials, fey, fiends, or undead within three miles
        ◦ there is a faint influence from the Feywild within the three mile radius of the spell. It’s hard to say what form that influence takes, but it’s probably not an open portal
        ◦ there are abundant mushrooms within a 3 mile radius, including an incredibly powerful fungal-like presence VERY deep below him that reminds him of Psilofyr (he thinks it’s probably Aramacos)
        ◦ Lana casts the spell again and learns there’s no entrances to the Underdark within 3 miles, which is a relief to Kaz since entrances to the Underdark are VERY dangerous and elves always block them off when they open up
    • Lana goes on a mushroom hunt. Kaz tells her about Snickermottle – a rare brown mushroom used to make a kind of potion that will let the drinker see the future – and Lana locates several about 3 miles away. She shapeshifts into an eagle and flies to quickly retrieve it while the rest of the party makes preparations to leave. She also finds a Rizznack, an extremely rare mushroom that causes magical mist to pour out of your eyes and ears (like the Fogcloud spell) for an hour after being eaten.
    • While Lana is on her mushroom hunt, Kaz and Nev walk around the forest for a bit, then head back to Torthyr. Kaz catches up with a few people.
    • The party leaves in the afternoon, after a hearty lunch of Erudir’s famous stew. Before she goes, Erudir asks Kaz if she’s safe, and she cops out with “As safe as I can be.” He looks dubious, and Kaz desperately follows up with “Well, I’m still here aren’t I?” “...That ye are” he responds.
    • Erudir also asks why he has to wear the amulet all the time, and Kaz explains that Asger is still out there and she’s worried about him. He promises to wear it, and Odo suggests he put Abyssal  chicken grease on it if it becomes uncomfortable. He starts rambling about how he used to keep Abyssal chicken in the alchemy jug until Kaz made him stop, and Erudir genially slaps him on the back and says “I like ye. Take care, son.”
    • We all wave goodbye to Erudir, Lorelei, Rhyleigh, and the rest of Torthyr. Lana casts Travel Through Trees, and we all hear Éire say “that tickles” as we go through.
    • We head to our home in Sigil. Kaz casts Sending to Ganth to update him on what Fredryk told the party (though she doesn’t share Fredryk’s name).  He immediately teleports to the party’s home for the full story, which we share. He’s absolutely floored by the information, and seems quite distracted. Kaz can tell that Ganth is very old and wise, and is a good judge of the truth of things, and she can feel his scrutiny as he tries to determine if she’s telling the truth.
        ◦ The pink building had three distinct towers that each look like something you’d turn on a lathe (odd bulges and all), topped with spherical domes. They do NOT look like the dark tower from Nev’s vision.
        ◦ Nev knows that the cultist was wearing high priestess attire.
    • Ganth teleports away to go get Torvald (halfling leader of the Watchful Voyagers) so we can tell him the story (since we’ve come back with the best lead the Watchful Voyagers have had since the corrupted celestial business began). Torvald has a kindly glimmer in his eyes, but he’s clearly surprised and alert. We welcome him to our home, and Kaz and Nevaeh relay the story. He’s focused on Nevaeh, since it’s her father who’s gone missing. We again refuse to give up Fredryk’s name, and Torvald ruefully notes that the Far Flung Fellowship and the Watchful Voyagers need to work on building trust.
    • Torvald agrees that we’re the best ones to investigate the tower, and it’s the smartest next move. He suggests that we work together, by having some of the more experienced Watchful Voyagers  scout out the city for us in advance. 
    • Kaz asks why Zeletar is difficult to navigate. Ganth explains that there’s an almost magical tendency to forget the twists and turns of streets you’ve already been on. He agrees to get a stone or other object from a location near the pink building so we can use it to Find the Path from a portal to the building.
    • Torvald recommends we plan a stakeout of the pink building, rather than trying to break into it and put ourselves at risk. He also says that he likes Kaz’s idea of getting into Zeletar as thrill-seekers on a tour. Smutlana suggests paying off a demon working in the building to turn on those within. 
        ◦ Zeletar takes up three layers of the Abyss, and is essentially three different cities intertwined by portals.
    • Torvald and Ganth leave to prepare. Kaz and Nev get some hairdye (red, like Kaz’s hair) to dye Nev’s hair. Late that night, Kaz gets a Sending message from Ganth. “Go on the tour tomorrow. Our representative will find you. Message me where the portal leads in Zeletar to make yourselves easier to find.”
    • The next morning, around peak (noon), we arrive for the Zeletar tour. The tour guide is a tiefling with an eyepatch named Rosewine Thraxon. He checks the group over. Kaz and Nev, are wearing their usual attire, and Odo is dishevled and colorful. Lana takes one look at the rest of the tour group, which is dressed for a rave, and immediately makes herself look like “rave pikachu.” Rosewine is less than impressed by Nevaeh’s Armor of Gleaming and lack of rave gear, so Lana gathers spare rave gear (extra bracelets, face paint, etc) for her. Kaz makes her cloak look more rave-like.
    • We enter Zeletar through a one-way portal into an area with loud, reverberating music and flashing lights. We’re also immediately hit with a sense of wrongness, but one more exhilarating and deeply twisted than Hades’ aura of despair. Lawful good Kaz is very uncomfortable in such a chaotically evil place.
    • Kaz casts Sending to Ganth to let him know where they are. He finds the party (though they can’t see him) and casts a spell so they can all communicate telepathically with him and with each other. He explains that the pink building is near the Argent Palace, where Graatz the Prince of Darkness lives. The Far Flung Fellowship sets off to reach it.


Kaz has cast Dimension Door into the spell storing ring

- keep spying on Asger
- look into the Conduit some more (ask about elvish ruins with Commune? Was Drosys on Faerun
when he found the Conduit?)
