    • Angela agrees to stay in Brin's Haven for her own safety, so we leave Sigil, then Planeshift there. Angela is stunned by the demiplane, but Kaz explains it to her, and Boswell shows up soon after. He helps her find a room to stay in, she explains that she wants a job if she’ll be staying there, and the two start discussing her skills and jobs that will fit her well.
        ◦ Kaz knows that she doesn’t have family in Silverymoon, so they should be at least somewhat safe from Asger
    • We descend to a two-level underground training room, with various false terrains for people to practice in. We spend most of the day learning to walk around in the fiend suits. We also learn from Boswell that the merchants will deliver a shipment of viperwine and other goods to the Hall of Debate on the morning of the 14th. The caravan will travel through the ruins of a city on its way to Grenpoli, where we can ambush them. Presumably the barrels of viperwine (which we’ll be hiding in) will be brought straight to the wine cellar. Once we’re in the Hall of Debate, we’ll have to find out where the action is happening
        ◦ When there are too many concurrent planeshifts in the same spot in the lower planes, it’ll be detected, so the Watchful Voyagers can’t bring too many people to ambush the convoy. We’ll have to be part of the ambush team.
        ◦ Kaz is still claustrophobic from the githzerai monastery incident, and 
        ◦ We may not be able to teleport out of the Hall of Debate
    • The fiend suits can be worn indefinitely (Boswell once wore one for four days, though we should be out in less than a day, if all goes well). The fiend suits are NOT durable enough to fight in – aside from the fact that Grenpoli is a diplomatic city filled with insanely powerful fiends, the suits would be damaged very quickly and it would be immediately obvious that we were wearing suits
        ◦ Our fiend suits are meragons (legion devils), the bulk of devilish infantry foot soldiers. They’re typically obedient and subservient, and can be used as servants in diplomatic contexts. They don’t speak, but do communicate with telepathy. They don’t typically do magic, and it’s best not to be seen casting any. Our suits will allow us to understand infernal and use telepathy, and to appear as fiends to detection magic. And, since we’re immune to scrying, we won’t be detected when the devils scry into the barrels.
    • Over the next four days, we’re trained in how to properly greet superiors and other fiendish customs. We’re shown different devils we’ll likely see and their ranks. We’re given fake legions and cohorts in Maladomini’s army. We’re also told that the black rings we stole off the fiends in the sewers might give us some special standing. However, though meragons are typically ignored, we might need to improvise a cover story at some point, since no one knows enough about what’s happening at the meeting to create a good cover for us.
    • Kaz spends the evenings hanging out with Angela. She’s learning all about the planes and the Watchful Voyagers’ mission, and is very into it all. Kaz helps her with her planar studies. She also casts Sending to her dad several times, and he tries to tell her a story and gets cut off by the word count every time.
    • Odo spends one evening keeping his promise to Chazzick and playing marbles with him. He also comes across Asum (the dragonborn fighter) and Sten (the barbarian) from the battle in Akkaron. They all make peace and talk shop about fighting for a bit. They also warn him to be careful around Emmealot, since she didn’t take kindly to the rude awakening. Odo explains that he was descended from werebears and that he was trying to be a better person in their honor. He asks if there’s anything he can do to pitch in and help, but Sten explains that they’ve heard he’s pitching in just as much as anyone else. Asum also tips Odo off that Emmealot probably wants a rematch, since she felt it was unfair that she’d gotten surprised awake in their last fight.
    • Lana practices netting until he’s proficient in it.
    • Nev puts in some extra practice with the fiend suits, since she feels most worried that the devils will see through to her celestial heritage. Lana and Kaz practice with her. She also reaches out to some of her friends and family in Waterdeep. Othar says that they’ve had funerals for the people killed in the ogre raid, and that Sir Gondrian and his men are after the ogres. Nev asks what he did for the Reign of Misrule, a Waterdelvian holiday that allowed people “to disregard oaths and promises, the rules of their occupation, mercantile and guild contracts, religious dogmas, and all and social restraints, and generally act out of character.” He says he completely forgot about it with everything going on, and that he “owes the servants a meal” where he’s serving them.
    • The day before the mission, Boswell informs us that we’ll be scouting out the ruined city to plan our ambush with him and Ganth (who insists on coming). We pull Meili and Sten to come along as well, for both the scouting and the ambush mission. They’re both very proud to be invited.
        ◦ Maladomini used to be mostly populated, until a giant war in the Nine Hells reduced most of the cities in the layer to ruins
    • How the party feels about the mission:
        ◦ Kaz: She may not see this as a suicide mission, but she’s certainly prepared to die. She leaves a letter with Angela for her father, in case she doesn’t come back, and leaves copies of her notes in a safe place. However, she knows that if demons and devils are really abandoning the Blood War and working together to conquer the multiverse, then the fight will come to her eventually, and she’d rather have the agency to fight that outcome now.
        ◦ Lana: For him, this is just another day on the job. He’s also not unaccustomed to behaving around powerful fiends after spending time as Ranjat’s slave.
        ◦ Nev: Scared shitless. She doesn’t want to be there, doesn’t want to do this.
        ◦ Odo: The mission is necessary. It may be able to solve some conflicts, and we need to get Nev’s dad back. If this is what’s in our path, then it’s what’s in our path, and it’s for a greater purpose. He cares less about his family’s deal with Asmodeus and his father’s orders to avoid the Hells than he does about doing the right thing.
        ◦ Boswell, Ganth, and Meili seem fairly relaxed about the mission. Sten has never been on such an important mission before, and he’s excited.
    • The day of the ambush dawns. Ganth planeshifts us to the ruined city, and we hide among the rubble. Soon enough, two armored war machines rumble down the road, driven by two blue-skinned mercali (planar merchants) and guarded by four giff (hippo people). The second war machine looks like an atv, driven by a fire giant. A horned devil flies above the caravan.
        ◦ Lana drops a cloud of necrotic spores onto the front ATV, which corrode the metal. That was the ATV we didn’t want damaged, so we could use it to sneak ourselves into Grenpoli.
        ◦ The fire giant drives his stupid ATV through the building Kaz was hiding in, collapsing it and burying her under rubble (20d6 damage). She screams in pain and starts cursing in Elvish, but manages to wiggle out of the rubble. The fire giant revs his atv again just as Kaz spits her vilest curse at him and casts Mental Prison, surrounding him in an illusion of the Elemental Plane of Water that he can’t stop himself from driving through.
        ◦ Odo slugs a potion of speed and finishes off the fire giant by slicing it through the kneecaps. He then runs over to Kaz, who’s stuck in melee with a giff, and does a bait-and-switch with her. She whirls around him with a telepathic “Thanks, Odo!”, slaps her hands on the giff’s shoulders, and electrocutes him to death.
    • Finally, the party emerges triumphant from the battle. Odo uses the last of his Speed juice to hide the bodies before the Haste exhaustion catches up to him. Ganth fixes the damage to the first war machine, but the magic clearly takes it out of him. Nev high-fives Meilli as we all jump into the war machine, put our fiend suits on, and head toward Grenpoli at top speed.



Reminder:

    • Spell storing ring contains Dimension Door
    • concentrating on Hex
    • Nev resists “infernal wound” from horned devil’s poison tail

see if we can find jugs to carry some of the viperwine, so we can lie and say we’re bringing it to the banquet hall if we’re questioned about why we’re going there.

To Do:
Questions for Exilicor: (mostly for flavor, because Kaz is still curious about them/the Far Realm)
Are you a god/power?
Are you from the planes originally?
Are there any portals between the planes and where you are? 
learn how to tune a planar tuning fork to a specific plane/layer of a plane
find a way to destroy the Conduit (since the mythallar can’t be used without it anyway, and that’s what Exilicor wants with it)
###################################################################################
MAYBE WE CAN USE ASGER’S STOLEN SHIT TO TRACK HIS LAB ON WHICHEVER PLANE ITS ON
sell nothing of his in Sigil, so he doesn’t know we’re connected to the city when he scries for it.

(so we've got two hours to chat telepathically inside these barrels huh? I hope nobody is claustrophobic)
John Dungeon Master — 03/06/2023 1:19 PM
(you can probably get into the fiend suits and then take a short rest outside of the barrels before you hide)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/06/2023 1:21 PM
(Oh good. That'll be cramped.)
(is it possible to speak to only one person telepathically or are we all linked no matter what?)
John Dungeon Master — 03/06/2023 1:23 PM
(with the telepathic bond, I think its basically an open channel)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/06/2023 1:24 PM
(What about with the fiend suit telepathy?) 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/06/2023 1:24 PM
(will thinking in a language other than common work, or are the suits going to translate everything)
John Dungeon Master — 03/06/2023 1:25 PM
(fiend suit telepathy is one-to-one)
(thinking in a language other than common? telepathy is always language-agnostic)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/06/2023 1:27 PM
(I'm trying to talk to Ganth but I wanted to just talk to him only)
John Dungeon Master — 03/06/2023 1:28 PM
(you could probably use fiend suit telepathy for that)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/06/2023 2:37 PM
Nev reaches out telepathically. "Ganth, what's really going on with you? You might be able to hide the severity from some of the others, but this is what I do. I know what it looks like to watch someone languish before ultimately passing away. I want to be able to help."
John Dungeon Master — 03/06/2023 3:55 PM
Ganth responds telepathically back to Nev: "I thank you for your concern for my wellbeing, but unfortunately the only thing that would alleviate my illness is something I cannot do.  All mortals pass away, eventually" 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/06/2023 7:39 PM
"Yes, but...perhaps I could help with the pain...at least?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/06/2023 7:58 PM
Kaz fiddles with a bit of flimsy metal she'd picked up off the caravan floor, clearly unaware of Nevaeh's telepathic conversation. She looks around at the group. "So what do you think this whole meetin's gonna be about?" 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/06/2023 8:22 PM
Nev is staring off into nothing because she can't focus on more than one thing at a time (lol)
John Dungeon Master — 03/07/2023 8:41 AM
Telepathically back to Nev, Ganth says: “I do not suffer pain, only fatigue, but I assure you, I am fine. Focus on your task ahead.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 9:12 AM
"...alright" She snaps back to reality and snorts like an annoyed teenager "Hmph."
"I have no idea, Kaz. Do you have any thoughts? I'm just curious who all is going to show up....who or what"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 12:03 PM
She shrugs. "Well, presumably the Archduchess Glazia will be there. Maybe Graatz too." You know her well enough to guess that she's making a face behind her mask. "If we're really unlucky, there'll be demons there too"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 12:28 PM
Nev is sweating in her suit. "Goddess, I hope not. These suits have got to work. I feel like demons are just going to...smell it on me." She looks over at her Selune shield
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 03/07/2023 12:32 PM
Odo inspects the barrel to see how to be the most cozy in it eventually 
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 12:47 PM
Kaz smiles reassuringly, then remembers that Nev can't see it. She pats her arm comfortingly instead. "They won't. And besides, we'll probably go mostly overlooked anyway."
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 1:32 PM
(Potentially y'all might notice Nev's not looking up or looking at any of you for this whole ride)
John Dungeon Master — 03/07/2023 1:33 PM
(I assume you’re mostly all waiting to get in the barrels till you get close)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 1:34 PM
(Yeah)
John Dungeon Master — 03/07/2023 1:34 PM
(Kaz and Lana have high passive perception and would probably notice Nev)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 1:38 PM
(Do we need to worry about giving ourselves different names, or would this species not have names, due to their low ranking status?)
John Dungeon Master — 03/07/2023 1:40 PM
(They would use their serial numbers)
(I assume this was all worked out as part of your preparation)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 1:36 PM
Kaz seems equally lost in her own thoughts for a while, but she does eventually notice that Nev seems off. She hums with concern. “What’s wrong, Nev?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 1:47 PM
"I don't like this, Kaz. It's...wrong. Visiting the lower planes is bad enough but now we're parading around as if we're a fiend ourselves. Acting like them, looking like them, smelling like them. It's abhorrent. And...I'm the reason why we have to do it." She sighs deeply  "And I hate that."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 2:01 PM
Kaz sighs. "It's what needs to be done. And you're not the reason we have to do it. We're doing it because we need to know if the Blood War is really on the verge of endin'. And we need to be prepared if it is, because everyone we know and love will be in a lot of danger if that happens." She shrugs, shoulders tense with her own anxiety. "Your da just... happens to be involved"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 3:38 PM
She winces. “Yeah, I guess you're right. I suppose in some world we would have ended up here anyway. Meeting Ganth and them.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 3:40 PM
She shifts, pulling her knees to her chest. "I'm glad we did. It's nice to have people backing us up, and I don't think we'd have gotten this far on our own. Gods forbid we'd tried to spy on the pink buildin' by ourselves. We wouldn't have even known what the Black Rings were."
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 6:11 PM
"And Selune redirecting us from the pink building to the tower Gilbert was in...perhaps knowing we weren't ready for that yet too. It's all just been a whirlwind of chaos. Chaos leading in the same direction though I guess...so...orderly chaos?" She looks confused and frustrated.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 6:41 PM
“Or perhaps leading us to someone in need of our help, and to a more important piece of the puzzle.” She thumbs through her journal apprehensively. “I’ve been wonderin’ how I fit into all of this, after what Ganth said about our destinies bein’ intertwined. Smutlana was enslaved by a fiendish diplomat, your da got kidnapped by fiends, and Odo’s family- well, you know. But for me, the only connection I can come up with is the mythallar. Presumably it would get used as a way to shift entire armies between planes, but as far as I know Asger won’t be able to get it working without the Conduit.” 
She clutches the journal a bit tighter, not really looking at the page. It’s open to a drawing of the Uvorin Decemvirate’s ten pointed star, labeled with each member’s name. “I don’t know, maybe I’m overthinkin’ all of this, but I keep worryin’ that there’s something I’ve missed” 
John Dungeon Master — 03/07/2023 6:42 PM
🍿
(Just enjoying the conversation)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 6:52 PM
"Maybe some of the missing pieces will come into place at this meeting?....I dunno."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 7:04 PM
"That's what I'm hoping." She lets her legs drop to the floor, leaning back against the war machine's side with a groan. "After this, I'm goin' to the spa and gettin' a full body massage. Maybe spend a few days in the Upper Planes too."
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 7:06 PM
"Oh, can we?! That would be incredible. Without having some hidden agenda for being there..."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/07/2023 7:07 PM
"Oh gods, definitely. I need somethin' ta look forward to after all this."
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/07/2023 9:39 PM
“I feel like there will be diplomacy of the worst kind at play. Devils conspiring with fiends. The only thing worse than that would be the two of them conspiring with celestials.”
He turns to look Nevaeh square in the face. “If there were anyone else in the entire Planescape who could wear these suits and do this job, then they’d be here instead of us. But there’s no one else but us. We’re the right team for the job. The only team. Who else could have gone face to face, solo, with a horned devil and made it flee but you, Nevaeh?”
“We’re here because all the planes are at risk if the devils ally with the demons. This isn’t the time for hesitation and self-doubt. If this were not our path, and not your path, Selune’s light would have illuminated a different path. But if her light points into the darkness, as it has many times as now, then who are you to deny her judgement? As a Lunar Maiden, are you not compelled to fulfill the eternal promise of the moon, that She is our twilight sanctuary in the darkest of nights?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/07/2023 10:04 PM
(oh you)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/07/2023 10:08 PM
Smutlana looks inspiringly at Nev for a moment and then preens Nekropoietes’ skull for some time while blinking and nodding. Then he sucks a bit of air through his beak in slight disappointment, turns the skull to face him so that he’s looking directly into the eyes. “Well, you’re not wrong about that. I’m happy when you’re happy. But don’t worry, you’ll meet her soon enough.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/08/2023 2:11 PM
Kaz squeezes Nev’s shoulder reassuringly. She glances over when Lana starts talking to Nekropoietes, eyeing the staff warily. “…who, exactly, is the demon staff excited to see?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/08/2023 3:04 PM
“Yeah...who's her?”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/08/2023 7:26 PM
Smutlana rolls his eyes at the party. “Heather. Duh.”
“Well Neko isn’t a demon staff. It’s just… a staff! And quite a good one I might add. But yeah, it was just disappointed that I didn’t get to introduce Heather. Because everyone loves Heather.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/08/2023 7:34 PM
"Mmmm, yeah I guess we haven't seen her in a while." "Does the staff want to talk to any of us?" She stares at the staff like she's staring at an empty wall
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/08/2023 7:52 PM
Smutlana glances at Neko shortly for a response, then bursts out in uncontrolled chortling and has to steady himself with the staff. “All flesh is borrowed from The Circle and will return to it. Each in their time. Neko’s only interest is in hastening the process. Luckily, we seem to encounter so many folks who flock to us, yearning for the separation of their souls from their own bodies. For why else would they dare cross us, if only to refund their flesh back into The Circle?”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/08/2023 7:54 PM
“Fiends don’t really leave flesh behind when they die” Kaz mumbles
“But what was so funny, Lana?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/08/2023 8:06 PM
She shakes her head and starts staring at her fiend-suited hands
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/08/2023 8:09 PM
“I know!! That’s what Neko was bemooooooaning”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/08/2023 8:21 PM
Smutlana stifles a chortle physically with his hand/ “I’d tell you more about Neko’s grim sense of humor, but there would be… reaper-cussions.”
“Get it? Grim… reaper-cussions?” Smutlana looks around fishing for laughs “It’s a death staff with a literal skull on top.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/08/2023 8:24 PM
Kaz manages a snort. “Please just tell me it’s not evil. I know necromancy itself isn’t evil, but that staff worries me”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/08/2023 8:33 PM
“Well the most powerful necromancer here is technically Nevaeh. You’ve seen her do it. And no one’s giving her any side eye… not that she deserves any. Just saying, evil isn’t a state of being as much as it is a state of doing. And Neko won’t be doing any evil in my hands.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/08/2023 8:37 PM
She sighs, relaxing slightly. “I’m only worried because when I was researching warlock pacts, I heard of some poor folks bein’ bound to sentient weapons. But as long as your hands are the ones in control, I’m not worried”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/08/2023 8:44 PM
“Oh for sure. I’m not trying to get brainwashed again. If you start seeing me acting crazy be sure to… be… sure…” Smutlana starts making sharp twisting motions and reaches out both arms towards Kaz with a shit-eating grin… “let me eat your brainsssszzz?!”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/08/2023 8:48 PM
Kaz rolls her eyes under the mask, smiling as she shoves Lana off. “Easy there, I think my brain might poison ye”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/08/2023 8:48 PM
“Blech, I'm not a necroman....er...nevermind. It's just a staff that looks creepy, that's all.”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/09/2023 4:26 PM
Smutlana jerks around mechanically and starts lumbering toward Nevaeh “One cleric’s trash… is another Druid’s treasure… moon brainszzzz pleeeease!!”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/09/2023 4:29 PM
"Omg, don't you tickle me" defensively curls up in the fetal position She finally lets out a laugh.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/09/2023 4:38 PM
Kaz scoots out of the way, neither attacking with tickles nor defending, lest she get dragged into the tickle fight as well. There’s laughter in her voice when she speaks. “Never thought I’d see a meragon try ta tickle someone ta death. Maybe this meetin’s gonna be about tickle war strategies”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/09/2023 4:59 PM
"Wonder if anybody has ever tried to take down a devil with tickles? For all we know it's their secret weakness."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/09/2023 5:01 PM
“Could be. Though, if we’re goin’ back to childhood battle strategies, I prefer pillow fights”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/09/2023 6:57 PM
“I think I might rather melt their faces off with Neko, but I think it could be cute to watch you give it a try” Smutlana tries to make a an UwU face
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/09/2023 5:03 PM
"Never really thought about how demons sleep. Think they use pillows with big plush beds?" She laughs at the thought of it
John Dungeon Master — 03/09/2023 5:03 PM
The wagon suddenly hits a pothole in the road causing the cargo trailer to violently bounce and knocking everyone down
Barrels are knocked over and some leak. The acrid reek of viper wine fills the trailer
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/09/2023 5:05 PM
“Do they need to sleep? My parents always told me they stayed awake constantly, looking for misbehavin’ kids-” she bounces in place, scrabbling at the metal wall for balance. A bit of viper wine sloshes onto her. “…ugh. No point cleanin’ this off, I guess”
John Dungeon Master — 03/09/2023 5:06 PM
Ganth says telepathically: “sorry, that came out of nowhere”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/09/2023 5:54 PM
“What was that?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/09/2023 6:22 PM
"Aww, man. This stuff is vile."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/09/2023 6:47 PM
“Do you think baatezu enjoy bathin’ in wine like rich people? Wait.” She studies Nevaeh. “You’re rich. Do you know anyone who would bathe in wine because they could afford to?”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/09/2023 6:57 PM
“Let’s make sure to put everything away before we arrive. We could be getting close at this point.”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/09/2023 10:53 PM
“I mean, I don't know about rich. Not in comparison to some of the folks I grew up with at least. But I'm not going to pretend that having my own home with servants isn't privileged.”
“I have actually done a wine bath. But it was kind of just like wine poured into the water to turn the water red colored. I just thought it looked kind of cool and fancy.”
“I have taken a milk bath before. Your skin feels incredible afterwards.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/09/2023 11:51 PM
Kaz looks fascinated. “Like, an entire bath of milk? Or milk poured into water, like the wine bath?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/10/2023 12:17 AM
“A little more milk, but still water. You guys saw our ritual of pouring milk over the altar, creating moonfire even once. Milk wasn't too hard to come by as a Selunite Cleric. I'd get it as a gift a lot for work I'd do for the locals. Back when I thought I'd be blessing babies and sweeping the floor of the House of the Moon for the rest of my life.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/10/2023 1:28 PM
“Do you think you’ll go back to the House of the Moon, once all of this is over?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/10/2023 2:18 PM
"I guess. I haven't thought a lot about it. Maybe I'll be promoted past sweeping up." She chuckles
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 03/10/2023 3:32 PM
“After what I saw you do to that horned devil with your hammer, I wouldn’t want to be the one to explain you’re not getting a promotion this cycle.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/10/2023 4:32 PM
Kaz chuckles. “Lana’s right. You more than deserve one”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/10/2023 4:39 PM
"Hey, we all do." 
"What do you think you'll do when all of this is over?" She looks to the group.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/10/2023 10:58 PM
Kaz drums her fingers on her journal. She takes a moment to speak, and it’s slow and thoughtful when she does start. “I think… I’d like to bring my Ma back, and spend some time together as a family again. I don’t know for how long - gods know I couldn’t stay away from the multiverse now that I’ve seen so much of it - but at least long enough to get to know her again”
She manages a stiff shrug, speaking with a forced airiness. “And if she doesn’t want to come back, I suppose I’d just get back to explorin’ a bit earlier than I’d planned”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 3:20 PM
"That sounds like a good plan." Nev smiles. "You can do all the things you missed out on. Even if that's just… sitting around the fire at night, talking." She nods. "Hopefully I can help make that a reality for you and your dad."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 3:40 PM
She relaxes a little. “Aye, we can’t thank ye enough for it, Nev. And I hope to return the favor by helpin’ you bring your Da back safe and sound as well.” 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 3:51 PM
"I'll just be happy to be able to talk to him again." She shifts around to lay against the side of a barrel "It's like… if you spoke to your best friend every day and then one day they just… disappeared. No goodbye, no way to contact them again, just gone." Then, quietly, "The echoes in your house get a little louder."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 4:08 PM
Kaz quietly puts her hand on Nevaeh's shoulder. "We'll get him back," she says softly. "I promise"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 4:44 PM
"Thank you." She hugs Kaz's hand with her own "At least we'll all have a lot of stories to tell around the fire, until we're super old and gray!" She chuckles.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 4:58 PM
She chuckles as well. "Aye. And I've kept a good account of our adventures too, which will keep the story alive long after that. It's no bard's tale, but speaking as someone who went through it all, it's compelling"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 5:20 PM
"Definitely compelling. Your dad can do some background music for us!"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 5:21 PM
"Oh aye, he'd like that. We could re-enact some of the battles too. Though, if my da IS gonna be there, maybe we tone them down a bit?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 7:05 PM
"Yeah... Maybe some of these stories are better left untold."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 7:06 PM
She shifts, crossing her legs beneath her. "Speakin' of tellin' stories... I think that if we can get proof of what's goin' on - not just of the coming war, but of the corrupted celestials - we should bring it to Lady Renalia and get her workin' with us and the Watchful Voyagers"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 7:50 PM
"Absolutely. If there's anyone that needs to know, it's her. If we want extra help anyway. And boy will we need it." Nve looks towards the driver's seats. "Goddess knows what the next steps will be."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 8:11 PM
"Well, she's certainly got experience funding the Blood War. And not all of the demons and devils must be in on whatever this plan is. I doubt Prazomal was the one to double-cross us back in the Abyss - why pay for weapons you know you won't receive if you double-cross the seller? Why attack the very ship carryin' those weapons, knowin' that they'll be turned on you?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 8:15 PM
(Prazomal sounds like a medication)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 8:15 PM
(it really does)
(Ask your cleric if Prazomal is right for you)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 8:16 PM
(Oh I snort-laughed at that)
John Dungeon Master — 03/11/2023 8:17 PM
(There’s an online quiz you can take where they give you one elvish name from Tolkien and one real pharmaceutical name and you have to differentiate them. It’s hard)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 8:18 PM
(I played trivia once where some of the questions were 'which is the Tolkien character and which is the antidepressant?' and it was so hard. Also they never listed the only antidepressant I knew RIP)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 8:23 PM
"Yeah... That never made any kind of sense." She very clearly hasn't thought about it
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 8:25 PM
Kaz very clearly doesn't notice. "Right?? It's been botherin' me for a while, but I certainly didn't have a better explanation for Lady Renalia when she asked"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 8:26 PM
"I wonder if she ever learned more but just didn't think we needed to hear it? Guess we haven't really asked about it."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 8:27 PM
"I don't know. It seemed like she wanted to write it off as another case of demons being untrustworthy. But you're right, we should ask"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/11/2023 8:32 PM
"I hope we can condense all of this info for her in the 30 minutes she can squeeze us into next week" 😆
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/11/2023 8:32 PM
She laughs. "Oh, thirty minutes is optimistic. I think we'd be lucky to get fifteen"
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 1:35 AM
Odo stops studying the barrel 
“Reckon I ain’t too darn fond a’ being down here neither - do suppose it be a bit warmer than Agathys, out there in that dangerous icy wasteland…” 
Odo looks towards Nev’s direction. “Reckon this here, uh, things done be mighty interestin’ how them there things in this here life intertwine - we is gonna find you Pa Nev, it’ll happen, I just know it”
Odo sniffs the empty bottle that held the potion of speed
“Hearin’ ya mention Lady Renalia…” He looks over at Kaz “A bit of me still done be a mighty curious about Nay-Zell, I do done keep a thinkin’ if she do done know all about what we do done been gettin’ in… pramazol or what-have-you too… still do done think... hmmm”
Odo sniffs the outside of the barrel 
“I also figure... I done be a wonderin’ bout them there Shar Cultists too, that done been mayhaps a tad more active lately, with them there burnin’ of places like the Temple of Selune in Neverwinter. Almost be like they done trying to rot things away with flames…like that there Zernakshaw was a’ tellin Asger they would done be a rottin’ out his eyeballs, I mean, I reckon I’d kinda pay to see that…though done figure I guess I don’t got any coin on hand right this here moment”
Odo scratches his head
“Do done figure tho, a Spa day latter might be a mighty interestin’. That there Transcendent League that be right next door’s been a callin’ my name. Also reckon them there all who be a comin’ through there too got some mighty fine needlework done by Fell - figure mmm Fell, I be a needin’ to see tooooo…”
Odo trails off, staring at the suicide pill that Ganth gave him. “Figure none that done matter if we don’t get through all this though”
Odo chuckles
“Ahh, but we gonna get through this, I do done know!  It be good.  At least we do done fit in more now here, with these here suits, than we do done did in the City of Brass with them there grand sultan of whatever I done reckon be said with that there fancy word ‘incandescent’, still I don’t be a knowin’ what that mean, but yeah, you know I ain’t that ‘bright’”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/13/2023 10:38 PM
(I appreciate the pun)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/13/2023 10:39 PM
(god same 👌)
Kaz nods slowly. "That's a good point. Branaris followed one into the pink buildin', didn't he? I'm not too sure the Shar cultists are workin' together with fiends on this war, but I wouldn't rule it out either. We'll have to keep an eye out for any possible connections."
She snorts. "And don't worry, Odo. I'd pay for ALL of us to see Asger's eyes rot out of his skull." Her voice is sugary with vitriol
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/13/2023 10:47 PM
(that's Kaz's AIM handle, Sugary Vitriol)
"I just don't want to ever see him again. In this life or the next."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/13/2023 10:59 PM
(checks what AIM names tended to be
Learns they're basically early 2000s screen names 
Yeah, that checks out) 
Kaz clenches her fists. "I've never been this angry at someone before. I'm not sure what to do about it, honestly. And I feel bad about saying this, but I don't think I can feel safe as long as he's alive"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 12:09 AM
(God, am I that old? :eyebleach: )
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/14/2023 12:09 AM
(I've been forcibly reminded that I'm the youngest one here)
(I don't remember 9/11)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 12:10 AM
(I was a sophomore in high school)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/14/2023 12:10 AM
(To be fair, I know what AIM is, I've just never used it)
(...I was in preschool)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 12:11 AM

Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 12:13 AM
"We have no idea what his ultimate goal is, so nobody is safe. But... I guess that's why we can't fail huh?" She chuckles nervously
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/14/2023 12:14 AM
Kaz sighs, shoulders slumping. "Aye. We can't"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 12:15 AM
She starts chanting a bit "No pressure. No pressure."
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 12:16 AM
(Fuck, I was a junior. Not a sophomore. It keeps getting worse)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/14/2023 12:16 AM
She clutches her journal tightly, voice high pitched and strained. "Nope. It's just your family and friends' lives on the line along with yours."
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 12:18 AM
"Everyone we've ever loved. One already taken." Nev clenches her fist, thinking about seeing Jandar's charred remains "Tried to take, anyways."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/14/2023 12:36 AM
Kaz takes a deep breath, voice still a bit strained. "Let's talk about somethin' else. I learned a new spell recently? I can hold people in place now"
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 03/14/2023 1:01 AM
Odo's eyes grow wide, though through the suit they might not be as pronounced.
"Ohhhhhhh???? Reckon be it like they then done got sticky honey on their feets?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 9:09 AM
"Anybody?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/14/2023 10:39 AM
“Well, any humanoid. I’d have to tweak it a bit if I wanted to hold a monster or an animal”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 9:42 PM
"Well that could come in handy...when we want to hose Odo down."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/14/2023 9:55 PM
She laughs. "Easier just to use Prestidigitation, I think"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/14/2023 10:00 PM
"But more fun to use the hose."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/15/2023 9:18 PM
She hums, smiling as she starts to relax. "Did you two go on any adventures before we all met?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/15/2023 10:36 PM
"Hmmm, not really. We haven't worked together, if that's what you mean. I mean, we'd get into trouble every so often, especially running around Falcan's Roost and getting into stuff that we weren't supposed to. But nothing with any real danger."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/15/2023 11:17 PM
"I can imagine. What sort of trouble did ye get into?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/15/2023 11:26 PM
"Well, if I'm being totally honest, me and Tammy would kinda gang up on him, being the only boy. Chasing him around with threats of cooties and trying to make him eat mud pies. Which he does willingly now. She was attached to my hip for a little while when we were really young. I'd come over for slumber parties and stuff and we'd all stay up late talking and giggling at the dumbest stuff. Jandar would become part of the fun sometimes too when we were messing around in the stables. Picked up a lot of Elvish curse words back then."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/15/2023 11:31 PM
Kaz sighs longingly. "That sounds like a lot of fun. Rhyleigh, Lorelei, and I would go camping together all the time, have our own little slumber parties. Gods, I miss the simpler times." 
John Dungeon Master — 03/15/2023 11:34 PM
(So, just throwing it out there that Tammy is 12 years younger than Nev so like when Nev was 18 Tammy was 6. Now, that doesn’t necessarily invalidate any thing but it’s pretty funny to imagine Nev and Tammy, 18 and 6 bullying odo age 12 lol)
(But also, worth pointing out that Aasimar mature more slowly so Nev and Odo were kind of closer in apparent age)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/15/2023 11:41 PM
(yeah, I am 100% basing this off of my young cousins who I used to do this stuff with lol except that it was my brother. Poor guy. Lol)
John Dungeon Master — 03/15/2023 11:42 PM
(Lol)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/15/2023 11:43 PM
(My brother would chase me around with spiders to retaliate. Which is interesting now that it is come full circle and I'm the one that owns spiders)
John Dungeon Master — 03/15/2023 11:44 PM
(That’s funny)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/15/2023 11:47 PM
"It seems like a lifetime ago, huh? Me and Odo did have a treehouse to our own though for a while. I'd go study there sometimes even after the uh... Appropriate age to be up in a rickety tree house. Age and size. I got tall quick, it was embarrassing."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/15/2023 11:48 PM
Kaz chuckles. “I’ll be honest, I’m not quite sure what the ‘appropriate age’ is for treehouses among non-elves”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 03/15/2023 11:50 PM
"Maybe 'rickety' is the key word" chuckles too
"Your home was really nice. Incredible really. I'd love to go back and spend more time with everyone."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 03/15/2023 11:56 PM
“That’s inappropriate at any age” she says, with a playfully pompous tone. Then, more genuinely, “I’m truly glad I got to show it to ye. It’s been too far for me to show any of my other friends. Well, it wouldn’t be for Angela, but somehow we never got around to makin’ the trip together.” She tugs at a lock of hair, distracted for a moment by the looming threat to her friends and family, then shakes her head to clear it.
“I’m glad I got to see your home as well. Waterdeep is even more incredible than I’d pictured, and it was nice to have a personal guide through the House of the Moon”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 12:07 AM
"Yeah, it's easy to forget how special your home might be when you see it every day. But bring someone new along and you get to see it through fresh eyes again." She murmurs something to herself something about Asger getting too close.
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Yesterday at 9:49 PM
Odo chuckles and nods
"Ya know I done even think Tammy, with all her trainin' she done be a doin' with the House of the Moon and all, I a’ done figure she done be tryin' even more nowadays ta make me eat dem der mud pies."
Odo nods. "Reckon them there mud pies... sometimes the wurms done be the best part. I mean, reckon it's got good bits in the squirminess that done make ye a bit stronger" He thinks for a moment. "But them toads.... ugghhh...toads"
Odo shudders a bit
"Them toads like the mud too..."
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 11:37 PM
Kaz gags a bit. "Ugh, shite. Well, at least you'll be able to convincingly imitate a fiend who loves disgustin' stuff, Odo"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 11:48 PM
"I didn't know you were eating the worms, Odo. Gross."
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 12:35 AM
Odo squirms around like a worm on the ground in the fiend suit. "Lannnnaaa ayyy I be a squirmy wormy don't I be looking tasty?" 
He makes a slurpy worm sound.
"They do done say birds of them there feathers stick together ay?? Them there early birds gonnnna get them wurms ayyy?  Ya don't even need a net to be a catching me use them there insticts!"
Odo squirms around near Lana
