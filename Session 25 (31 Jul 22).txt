A few weeks ago, there’s the midsummer ritual right before Eliasus 1. Midsummer is a holiday that isn’t part of any month. It falls on a full moon this year, so we’re invited to the Temple of Selune to celebrate. As a cleric of Selune, Nevaeh is a big part of the rituals and ceremonies (milk sacrifices on an altar, dancing, etc), so we all went.

    • we meet Spen by the Gate to Bytopia. He leads us to the portal to the City of Brass (which is a grey area for entering the city. Most people enter through the city gates or through the harbor)
        ◦ the portal key is an amber ring
        ◦ two law codes: one for the Efreet, one for everyone else
        ◦ “keep your head down, don’t disturb the peace, don’t go to restricted areas”
    • we step through the gate and emerge into a HOT, red-lit open space. Those wearing the necklaces of planar adaptation are more comfortable with the heat. We’re stepping through a brass archway in an alleyway into a larger thoroughfare. The surrounding buildings are made of igneous rock, brass, gold and form domes, minarets, spiralling towers, and other huge buildings. The heat shimmers in the air. 
    • Surrounding us are tall red-skinned creatures walking or floating above the ground, with their lower halves made entirely of fire. There are also snake creatures entirely made of fire
    • We enter the Pyraculum District, the most cosmopolitan and commercial area. It hosts the main marketplace where most planar visitors spend most of their time. Illuminated patrols walk by frequently. They wear gold belts and wrist cuffs, white garb and white turbans with a golden flame symbol on the front.
    • we come to an enormous, crenelated, obsidian building. Illuminated guards stand at attention around it. Spen goes in to find out if there are any records on where specific confiscated items came from. An Illuminated patrol comes out and surrounds us to make sure that we’re not up to no good. Kaz hits them with a bit of flattery about the City of Brass to ease the situation.
    • Spen is very distressed to find us surrounded, and more so when they escort us into the building. He relaxes when he finds out that the Illuminated escorting us inside just wanted to check our story with the quartermaster.
        ◦ We are ‘ins’ (“Eens,” non-efreet)
    • The assistant quartermaster of the Pyraculum District is named Asim. We pay him a 100gp “expediting fee” to find out info about the mirror (plus a lot more to find out other information). He comes back with a metal book and reveals that the mirror was confiscated from a tiefling named Luca Furrel when she was arrested for ‘lesmagiste’ against the sultan and sold into slavery. She was purchased for 22gp by Horzeen al Rathi, the Salamander, a proprietor of Al Rathi’s Dukanserai, in the Iskalat District (which surrounds the harbor). 
        ◦ lesmagiste = crime of insulting a sovereign. Luca’s punishment was 7 years of slavery, she’s served 2 years
        ◦ Luca was part of a travelling musical performers group
    • It takes us a couple hours of searching to find Al Rathi’s Dukanserai, on the edge of the Iskalat District (near the Marelgate district, which is mostly warehouses). We learn that a dukanserai is a smoking parlor. Two interesting spikey creatures (devils) enter ahead of us, passing by two salamander guards.
        ◦ There are no Illuminated around, but Spen warns us that there could be seedy people near
    • We enter the dukanserai. Heavy smoke fills the air. A beam of light shoots down through several stories of a cylindrical building, shining on two tieflings (one male, one female), a human, and a tabaxi on a round stage playing music. Surrounding them are various cubicles with people smoking, and beneath the stage is a bar with a salamander bartender.
        ◦ Luca is playing a long-necked stringed instrument called a Tar
    • Another tiefling, Art, takes us to a booth on the second floor, where we can look over the balcony and see the performers. He seems shocked and nervous that we want to speak to the owner, but agrees to ask his supervisor.
        ◦ we order some “Abyssal Green” hashish, and smoke hookah while we wait. Kaz fakes it to look the part while keeping a clear head. Smutlana actually smokes the hookah and has a paranoia attack.
    • Art comes back, tells us that the owner is coming to speak with us, and beats a hasty retreat. Not long after, Horzeen comes over. He refuses to sell the slaves, but allows us to speak with Luca after her performance.
        ◦ he definitely seems to refuse just because he doesn’t want to sell to us, not because he cares about those slaves in particular
    • Luca and the other performers are exhausted. Their legs are chained, and they shuffle off the stage. Kaz gives her some water from the magic jug, and she drinks it once she has Horzeen’s permission
    • Kaz asks about the mirror. Both Luca and Horzeen look shocked. Luca looks like the question came out of left field for her. Horzeen is very sus, because we didn’t say we knew Luca beforehand and because we found out about her from the Quartermaster (he doesn’t seem to have a great relationship with the law). Horzeen tells Luca to go away and calls a guard over, but Kaz offers up 100gp to show her sincerity and Horzeen brings Luca back.
    • Kaz asks her where she got the mirror. She pointedly looks down at her chains, then says “I don’t remember” (implying that she wants us to free her in exchange for the information)
        ◦ Kaz watches her go, scheming
        ◦ Kaz’s Plan: Kaz goes back in alone while everyone waits outside, asks to speak with Luca again. Once Luca comes over, Kaz uses Dimension Door to teleport her outside to the others. Smutlana uses Gaseous Form her so that the chains fall off. Then Kaz changes her own cloak color/style to better disguise herself, and everyone sneaks away under Pass Without Trace 
    • We head back to Sigil, part ways with Spen, and then back to our home. Nevaeh gets a Sending message that evening, but in private so no one else knows anything about it. Kaz casts Sending to her dad to check in and say hello.
    • Nevaeh comes bounding out of the room in the morning, pissed off. She runs down to Odo’s room and demands to know why he hasn’t contacted his father, and why he and “Uncle Jasper” are reaching out to HER to make contact with him.
        ◦ Kaz comes downstairs, sees the drama, turns around and leaves
        ◦ Nevaeh, clearly pissed: “They didn’t sound happy. Do I sound happy?!” 
          Odo, having just woken up: “Is this a trick question?”
    • We head back to the City of Brass. Nev buys a magical warhammer in the afternoon. In the evening, Kaz enters the dukanserai and Nevaeh follows invisibly (using Mislead, which leaves an illusory double of her behind). Kaz is angrily ordered to leave, since Horzeen thinks she’s gonna mess with his slaves.
    • Nevaeh sneaks into the staff area. She sees a smoking prep area and a staircase leading down to a kitchen. A few slaves bustle through the kitchen, going in and out of a pantry off to the side. She tries to leave, but bumps into a table and makes some noise. A salamander guard heard, but didn’t see her, and slithers away, thinking it over. 
    • Kaz uses Dimension Door to teleport into the dukanserai, just above the performers, and manages to land on her feet. There are shouts of surprise as she appears and yells “should have let me talk to her!” Kaz tries to teleport out with Luca, but Luca is unwilling to come and Kaz ends up back outside alone.
        ◦ Kaz guesses (and Lana intuits) that Luca wasn’t willing to leave the other performers behind, since they were sold into slavery together
    • Inside is chaos. One salamander guard points to where he heard Nevaeh and shouts something in Ignin to the other guards. The performers are frozen on stage. Most of the patrons are staying out of the fight. Nev flies up to the open roof and has her illusory double run into the room, briefly tricking the salamanders into attacking it
    • Kaz blasts apart one of the two “lava children” (giants) who had decided to join the fray. The other immediately decides to stop attacking.
    • Luca, despairing: “What are you all doing? We’re all gonna get killed”
    • One salamander runs off into the employee section. We slaughter the remaining salamanders. As we finish off the last one, the side doors burst open again. Two salamanders emerge, followed by an enormous efreet with metal arms. He points to us and shouts angrily “You! You’re all going to die!”

John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
So it's the afternoon of Midsummer day. You're all home. There's a knock at the door.  Norman heads to answer it.
(I'm guessing your characters have completely forgotten about midsummer day) 
(where are all of you in the house and what are you up to?)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
(Would I have celebrated this before? Is it something they do on our plane too?)
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
Yes, actually it's unique to your part of your world.  Asara is from Toril like many of the others in this neighborhood, including Lady Renalia 
It would be maybe a little bit like a mix between Thanksgiving day and the 4th of July, but without patriotic overtones 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
So if I knew what day it was, I'd have likely been keeping track, and also probably really annoying about being excited to attend in another plane?
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
It's entirely possible and if Nevaeh is big on keeping track of time and dates then for sure you would.  I'm just wondering if all the frenetic activity and planar travel you guys have been doing would have thrown off your normal rhythms. But perhaps you have actually discussed it with a week ago one of the times you visited the temple, so maybe you were counting down the days
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
I have likely not been keeping track of the days so...lets see
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
(So, Norman answers the door and then goes to find Nevaeh)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
“Norman, hello! What's going on?”
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
“Forgive me, m’lady, priestess Asara is here to see you”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
“Oh, I'll be right out!” Nev pulls her hair back into a manageable mess, gets presentable clothes on and comes out to greet the priestess. “Hello! So good to see you. What brings you here? Can I get you anything?” Nev excitedly ushers her over to sit while she runs around the kitchen for a minute, blabbing on
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/01/2022
Kaz is munching on some of Odo's jerky in the kitchen, but waves hello as Nevaeh and Asara enter
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
“Hello! It’s so good to see you too! Happy Midsummer!”
“I thought I’d stop by and make sure you’re coming to our moon revel tonight” (she turns and greets Kaz)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
Nev gasps. “It's Midsummer!! I completely lost track of my days. I miss the full moon...” She perks up “We'd all love to come! Where is it taking place? Can I/we bring anything?”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/01/2022
In a FOMO-induced panic, Lana hears the commotion and rushes up from the basement mushroomery, releasing a savory bouquet of cinnamon and shiitake as she flings open the door
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
“Oh I thought you might have lost track of time, it happens often for newcomers to Sigil.” (Turning to Lana) “oh hello!”
(Turning back to Nevaeh) “If you’d like to you can bring milk for a libation”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/01/2022
Smutlana dusts off some mushroom flour from her apron. “Oh my, I wasn’t expecting company. I was just downstairs perfecting my Midsummer Midnight Mushroom Mooncakes, or as some people call them, “MMMM”. It’s a pleasure to see you again, Asara.” She drops into a curtsy 
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
“And of course comfortable dancing shoes!” (She gives everyone a big smile)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
(Would I know where we can get local milk, and from what type of animal it's from? lol I think we can probably make it in our jug too but Odo's been doing things with it so I'm not sure I want to use those contents for Selune)
“Yassss dancing!”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/01/2022
(We’ve cleaned that jug aggressively since last he perturbed it)
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
(You can get milk at the local market, it’s imported from various places and different animals)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/01/2022
Kaz grins "I'd love to go dancing!"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
“Yes, Kaz! Oh if it's anything like the festival at home, you all are in for a real treat. I'll go to the market today and get some supplies and perhaps an outfit!” (Or would I wear my vestments?)
(I have fine clothes too from Waterdeep but I'm sure Sigil has some awesome clothes as well)
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
Vestments for selunite priestesses are very dress-like. For a midsummer festival a summer dress is appropriate. Typically priestesses would wear blue white silver etc but styles vary with locale. You might have moon revel atire
That’s a very formal example
Asara has on a somewhat simpler variant of the above style
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
(Amazing, so exciteddd)
"Thank you so much, priestess. I'm afraid the day would have slipped away from me if you hadn't come by. We'll be there this evening. With bells on!"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/01/2022
Kaz flicks her cloak out dramatically, and its colors shift to a deep blue with silver trimmings. "Aye, we'll be there!" she says excitedly
John Dungeon Master — 08/01/2022
“Wonderful! It’s so nice to have a fellow priestess here, oh I do hope you’ll let me introduce you to everyone!”
“Oh! What a splendid  enchantment!” (Reacting to Kaz’s cloak)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/01/2022
She smiles, giving a little twirl "Thank ye! It comes in handy"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/01/2022
Ohhh Kaz, we need to get you something fancy to wear under that cloak, you'll have to go shopping with me! And Lana! You have to let me pick something out for you. looks around for Odo And you. points to Odo You're getting a bath!
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/01/2022
Kaz claps excitedly, bouncing on her heels. "A shopping trip! Oh, I haven't had new clothes in a while"
John Dungeon Master — 08/02/2022
So, probably some clothing will need to be tailored or altered but if you want to describe what you’re looking for I can price it for you
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/02/2022
How about this amazing gown 🥰 I'm gonna be so retroactively broke.  
John Dungeon Master — 08/02/2022
You can definitely have a dress like this made. It will take some time to tailor it. It will have to be real silk velvet rather than synthetic like the real life one and that will be not cheap
You maybe able to find a tailor who has a similar one mostly ready to go that would just need to be finished to your measurements. But your 6’1” stature is going to be a bit of an outlier for humanoid females so that might make it difficult
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/02/2022
We can just tack on some ruffles at the bottom, like my mom did with my pants growing up lol instant length!
I'll try to find a good fit in the market. Or maybe even another plane nearby that's easy to access? The Lady probably has some good suggestions.
John Dungeon Master — 08/02/2022
I admit I’m not an expert here but I have to imagine the fitting of the bodice portion would be proportional to the other dimensions too though right?
Maybe that can be altered easily
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/02/2022
(Some women are tall because they have long legs, so it’s not entirely unreasonable to find a dress that fits on top, but needs to be longer)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/02/2022
(brb, figuring out Nev's body shape lol)
John Dungeon Master — 08/02/2022
I guess character sheets should have spaces for full clothing measurements, who knew?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/02/2022
(Having actually sewn things before, taking out the hem to make it longer is probably the easiest modification. With the style of this gown, you wouldn’t need to worry about shoulder width too much either. Altering the cup size on top would be trickier.) 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/02/2022
That's the good thing about corsets underneath, you can just smash everything in there and make it fit
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/02/2022
(Actually shoulders might be tough. Idk)
John Dungeon Master — 08/02/2022
(It’s probably going to be a pretty high shopping check DC to get it like immediately)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/02/2022
Odo hearing the words "bath" is a little nervous...pauses mid chew on some abyssal chicken jerky
"I done figure..." 
Odo inhales deeply...sniffing himself...sniffs under his plate armor, sniffs his legs
"I mean, I ...I ain't that smelly and dirty" 
Odo nervously eyes dart around the room looking at Norman, Smutlana, Kaz, Udurora, and Nev 
"Maybe I could uh just use some of Smutlana's fungus that be a growing downstairs to uh maybe just uh kinda chop some up and use um to soak up uh my sweat or something, done figure them shrooms absorb uh the sweat"
"Reckon tis true I done be a sweating while we been on our travels" 
Odo looks to Smutlana sorta shrugging
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/02/2022
“Odo, how is that easier, or better, than just soaking in some water for a while?”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/02/2022
Odo shrugs sorta sighs 
"wellll what about uh going a swimming at a pond in Sigil as long as that there pond don't be like the pond with the green stuff out we did done seen on that there slug in Mechanus?"
John Dungeon Master — 08/02/2022
(There are public baths with large pools and Spas but no ponds you can swim in Sigil, except The Ditch, which is much dirtier than anything you saw in mechanus or anywhere else)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/02/2022
“There's poo in there”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/02/2022
Odo thinks...sorta nodding sorta shrugging
"Might be onnnna something Nevaeyuhhh...ya ...ya done be right figure some critters done do their business in there but reckon it may not be tooo too bad. Then again..."
Odo turns to Smutlana
"Smutlana!"
Odo's eyes grow big
"I reckon Smutlana, you did done mention how much ya wanted to goto a Bathhouse in Fort Gilbert and we done never went...if my noggin recalling it cause the bathhouse was destroyed ...them Gimley dwarf brothers was a working on repairs but I ain't know if they did ever even finish"
Odo stretches
"Bathhouse feel like a good idea in my noggin, maybe I could done trade some work for the bathhouse inn-keeper in exchange for a bathhouse thing they do where they a wack ya with the leaves and ya get to sweat"
"Reckon I don't member what that done be called...reckon being wacked with some leaves and a sweating and a taking a dip in a mighty cold water after done be the ticket "
Odo nods confidently
“But I reckon I done not got no coin, so done figure that bathhouse inn-keeper let me a do some work for him in exchange for Smutlana and I to done go get wacked with them there leaves, sweat, and dunk into that there mighty cold water they there got"
Odo looks at Smutlana, smiling
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/02/2022
Kaz looks dumbfounded. "Is... that some sort of Waterdelvian spa thing? Getting slapped with leaves and bathing in cold water?"
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/02/2022
Odo scratches his head
"Reckon I ain't tooo sure done figure I done had maybe heard ‘bout it at some time but I coulda been wrong"
Odo chuckles eyebrows raised
"Sound mighty nice don't it Kaz?"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/02/2022
"Uh... I don't really appreciate bein' slapped, actually. A cold swim might be nice, though?"
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/02/2022
Odo nods
"It kinda like less of a slap and more of wack, from what I done been hearing...but maybe I don't remember none this that well but... ya lie down on a stone surface all flat like with your head in yer arms, and then the wack ya with a branch that done got leaves on your back, maybe not a hard wack but a wack, I think it done have something to do with helpin yer body and they done got a big pit o coals burning they toss them water on and it done make the place mighty steamy and ya done be getting wacked with the leaves and them there branches by a worker over from that there yonder bath house."
Odo thinks more
"Reckon I don't wanna be slapped with no leaves on no branches either ...I done that too many times to myself running through them trees when I was mighty little" 
Odo thinks some more
"If they ain't got the leaves steamy room with them coals at the bathhouse, a cold dive into the water be mighty nice indeed"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/02/2022
“We have perfectly good baths here, just a few doors down, that don't require you to get hit with leaves and will get you clean. Which is all we need for you to attend this event tonight.”
John Dungeon Master — 08/02/2022
Norman says "Would you like me to prepare a bath in your chamber ma'am?" 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
“After my shopping, absolutely!” Nev runs off to get ready to go out to the markets
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo grumbles a bit but nods... sorta slumps back down in a chair to snack on some abyssal chicken jerky
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
"but, er, for master Odo?"
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo sighs and slumps further and further into the chair trying to be invisible
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
“There's going to be some awesome food there ya know....would be a shame if you missed it cuz of a little water...”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo perks up
"Yaaa knowsss.  Reckon that trrruuuuuueeeeeeeeeeeeee....mmmmmmmmm"
Odo starts to salivate thinking about the food, pushes the chair back, and walks over to Norman
"Norman let's make this cold and get it over with.  Food gonna get cold if we wait toooo long."
Odo grabs one of the rope made manacles, knots it up more to become a rope loofah
"Reckonnnnn I'd appreciate it Norman ifffff ya done get back here"
Odo points but can't quite reach all over his back, kinda like if you stick a sticker on the back of a bodybuilders back and the bodybuilder can't remove it due to Iack of flexibility
"Reckon ya help me with that Norman?"
"Also...reckon can ya make it mighty cold?...I done wanna feel like it be a snowing in there"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
“I uh...don't know if we pay him enough for that.”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo nods
"Ye right. Norman ya done do plenty as it be ya be doing"
Odo affixes the loofa rope manacle to the non-pointy end of the the spear
Odo then grabs the spear to make sure the spear with manacle rope loofah attached can reach that hard to reach spot on his back
Odo nods, pleased with himself
"Reckon thiiiisss’lll do"
Odo nods to Norman, and then begins to slowly walk up the stairs as if he's trying to sike himself up to take a bath
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
Norman sighs and says: “…I’ll fetch the water…”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
“I'm curious to see what everyone else is going to wear...I should probably buy Odo something...”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/03/2022
“Oh I’m always ready for a trip to the bathhouse Odo, but the idea is that you have to be fully clean before you get in the water anyways. It’s a matter of courtesy, you see.”
“Let’s make plans for that on the way back from the festival, sort of an after party thing. For now, let’s focus on the preparations. Outfits - with haste, mind you!”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo hears Smutlana from the stairs on his way to vanquish said foe that be named bath
"Outfits?!"
Odo calls out
"Hmmmm...."
Odo grumbles more, accepts his fate, continues up the stairs
"reaadyy when you done be Norman."
Odo's gaze locks at the empty tub, awaiting his fate
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/03/2022
(In sigil they’re prepared for everything I imagine, there are non-standard sizes of everyone, people who want a dress but have spikes and horns, etc, so I can’t imagine that this is entirely unexpected?)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
(John, let's say I wanted to make the bath water much colder, since I got the rope loofah on the non pointy end of the icicle harpoon, would it be possible to just burn a charge and cool off the water a bit more 😛)
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
(oh yeah totally)
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
(So you toss the icicle into the tub and it immediately freezes the water around it into a small iceberg which actually sinks due to the weight of the metal javelin. The remaining water quickly reaches 0 degrees.)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo looks over at Norman with eyes of intent
"ah"
Odo lathers up some soap on the rope loofah part on the cold cold cold icicle makeshift-harpoon-spear
"it’s time.."
Odo softly says under his breath, in his birthday suit, somewhat sitting on the edge of the tub
LOTS OF EXPLETIVES ensue, as Odo leans back into the water as if a scuba diver with gear is leaning off the boat back into the water - polar 'plunging' water - vigorously scrubbing down with loofah & soap - MORE EXPLETIVES A WIDE ARRAY... Some have no name nor make any sense - Odo splashes the water about like a trapped animal but focuses and continues to scrub and wash
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 08/03/2022
From downstairs, Smutlana clutches his non-existent pearls. “Does anyone need to check on Odo? Is he bathing or is someone trying to drown him??”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo eventually gets used to the colder water and calms down
"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" 
Odo let's out a long exhale as if finally relaxing
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/03/2022
“You couldn’t pay me enough to go up there and find out” Kaz says flatly, not looking up from her journal.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
(Odo's going to get frostbite)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
After a while Odo finishes up in the tub - the tub is now stained with dirt/grime/abyssal-chicken-grease/twigs/leaves/hay/alladrian-wine/moldy-smelling/elements-of-fungus/tidbits-of-demon-ichor/and-a-plethora-of-other-things - the water is far from clear it has a somewhat 'bear'able odor to it but it's still not great - as Odo has not cleaned since before we met Psylofir.
"Norman, do ya done reckon ya got some threads I done could toss on me?  Maybe reckon I could just towel offf with one of them bed-sheets or somethin'?  Maybe I done could just be-a-usin' it as some threads?"
Odo begins to take the threads he was wearing under the armor and wash them abrasively against the icicle spear harpoon with some of the leftover soap, sudsing them up in the dirty water - then wrings them out with his bare hands letting more gunk from the clothing and getting the water even dirtier
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
(Sooooo what kind of shopping checks do we gotta make to get this adventure started?)
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
(I’m open to suggestions about the kind of skills and abilities that come into play. But I imagine perception, investigation, and persuasion would be key)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
(Can I try to find a smaller tailor that would be really excited to see one of their gowns at the event, and I could like...hype up their work in exchange for a discount, or at least in exchange for getting the gown done today lol)
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
(Sure, you can always try)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
(That's what I'd like to try then! We'll see what happens lol)
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
(Ok, so are you heading into the market ward or looking locally in your neighborhood?)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
(I'd like to ask Lady Renalia for any suggestions to start)

So assuming you go to her front gate, an attendant there is handing out fresh apples from a barrel to everyone who passes by. Garlands are hanging around the gate. You find out that Lady Renalia is not available but Jevren rushes out to meet you and after quickly checking with members of the staff, he come back with a note from Linnessia that refers you to the shop of Sandwin, Vegner, and Nim in the heart of the Lady’s Ward.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
“Wonderful! Give the lady my regards!” She takes an apple and garland and heads out
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
(So is it just Nevaeh going?)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo gets dressed in whatever clothes are available
"Ayyy uh Nevayuhhhh Lady Renalia always super busssy, I done been wondering why she always so busy"
Odo is off and about following Nevayuhhh, somewhat disshelved but clean.
"Ayy Nevayuhhh you done think maybe ol' Marla be able to make some adjustments to this here plate armor?  I done been figuring...I probably been eating too much jerky and ale, it done be mighty tight round me arms... almost like ya make a done right fitting snug knot when ya hitchin' yer horse on a little wooden fence ay.  It be tight. Also, you done think maybe for Selune I shoulduh...shouldaaa, be more, ya know, fanciful like in what I done toss over me body with them threads?  ...reckon Smutlana done have all the coin, as I be mighty in debt, but maybe we done could find someone that done be like, willing to let me uh, borrow um for a night or something?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
(I'm sure Lana and Kaz want to come)
“Odo, you know if you just talk to your dad you could get some money to pay off Lana. We'll add it to the list of things to do when we go to Waterdeep. Sooner rather than later.”
“As a favor to me, I'd like if you could look presentable tonight, in some finer attire.” She sniffs the air “And maybe another bath.”
John Dungeon Master — 08/03/2022
(Oh wait you can’t say anything about his dad cause you don’t know yet lol)
(Although I guess that could have been a general observation that he has rich parents?)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/03/2022
Odo nods, sighs slightly
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/03/2022
(oh right, that conversation hadn't happened yet. Okayyy. Yeah I'd have assumed they had money)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/04/2022
Kaz munches on her own apple, admiring the shop fronts as they pass. "I think I'll get somethin' in silver. It'll fit in with the revel quite nicely"
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/04/2022
Odo looks around at all the shops
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/04/2022
(Here's what I picture Kaz eventually acquiring)
John Dungeon Master — 08/04/2022
You all arrive at the shop which appears to be a large building made of an off-white stone in the 1st and 2nd floors and wood above in the 3rd and 4th floors. A pair of metal barred gates in the facade on the first floor open into a covered area continuous with the street with thick pillars supporting the floor above. The large gates appear sized to allow sedan chairs and palanquins to be brought in. There’s a large circular stained glass window above in the forth floor level. It’s a fancy looking place.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/04/2022
“Whoa...look at that window”
(Is there someone around?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/04/2022
Kaz gawks at the window as well. "I think Lady Renalia sent us to where she does her shoppin'." She lowers her voice. "Might be a bit above our price range, but I do want to see inside"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/04/2022
“We're committed now.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 08/04/2022
Kaz nods firmly, linking arms with Nevaeh and Lana. "Aye. We're on a shoppin' mission, aren't we? Best get started." She marches them both inside.
John Dungeon Master — 08/04/2022
There are 2 well dressed gatekeepers who usher you all in
There’s an entry way into a high ceiling hall with a row of mannequins displaying the latest in high fashions for the trendy and wealthy. The walls are lined with glass mirrors. There is a scent of floral perfume in the air. A tiefling girl in a knee-length silk damask dress with a unicorn pattern eagerly greets you all with a winning smile. “Welcome! How may I help you? 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/04/2022
“Oh. My. Goddess. Your dress is amazing!”
John Dungeon Master — 08/04/2022
“Why, thank you! It was designed and made by Mrs. Nim” she turns around 360
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/04/2022
“It's beautiful. And tailored perfectly.”
“My name is Nevaeh, this is Kaz, Lana, and the one sulking in the back is Odo.”
John Dungeon Master — 08/04/2022
“It’s a pleasure to meet you all!” She curtsies
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 08/04/2022
Odo munches on some jerky
"Pleasure to meet ya too"
Odo perks up to be friendly to the shopkeep
"This uh...this all...be uh...might fancy"
Odo sees Kaz and Nevaeh are excited seemingly and has a small smile
"Uh..."
Odo sniffs deeply...then a bit more deeply...still...deeper... sniffing...turning his head around like a dog sniffing
"Mighty uh flower flowery smelling in here - y'all got a mighty big garden nearby?"
Odo looks puzzled because he can't tell where all the floral scents are coming from
John Dungeon Master — 08/04/2022
“What can we do for you today?”
(Can I assume everyone describes the things they are looking for and that you want them immediately?)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/04/2022
(Yup!)
John Dungeon Master — 08/04/2022
“Tonight?!…” she looks surprised
“Alright, I’ll go and see if any of our tailors have availability for a rush job”
She comes back in a few minutes “Mrs. Nim will see you. She thinks she can manage 3 more outfits today. Perhaps we can find something for the gentleman… um,” She looks at Odo “Excuse me Sirrah, we ask that you refrain from eating inside the shop, thank you.” She smiles
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/04/2022
“Oh goody!” Nev pulls the locked arm crew along.
John Dungeon Master — 08/04/2022
She discreetly whispers “The fee for the expedited service is generally 2lbs of gold (100gp) in addition to materials costs which could be anywhere from 1 to 10lbs of gold. Would that be within your budget?” 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 08/04/2022
“I think... Maybe?” Looks over at Kaz
(at the time we did, but we did just spend a bit for my magic hammer. I'm not sure how much was left from that)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 6:44 PM
(Is it 100 per person, or 100 total?)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 9:04 PM
(Per tailored clothing unit)
(So yeah per person)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 11:16 PM
“I'd like to try on some of the pieces first.” (And then try to 'haggle' as I mentioned earlier)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 11:22 PM
(So the prices she’s quoting are for custom designs, they generally don’t sell pre-made clothing here, the displays in the hall in front were essentially decorative prestige pieces)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 11:36 PM
The attendant, who introduces herself as Reina, says “If that sounds ok, then I can take you to see Mrs. Nim right now” 
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 4:40 PM
Odo just nods ...feeling out of place but still surprised how fancy this all is
