Vault of the mythallar
    • Asger’s head and shoulders are wreathed in black flames as he attacks. Odo steps up to go toe-to-toe with him and he smirks. Odo knocks him to the floor, but he gets back up, looks over his shoulder up the stairs, and calls out “Xirnaxxsha!” through his teeth. He turns back to the rest of the party. “This is your last chance to live. Talk.” None of the Far Flung Fellowship is swayed.
    • A creature appears behind Odo, with a canine head, a mage’s robe, and a wand. We recognize it as having been with Asger when he trapped Kaz’s dad (from Psilofyr’s vision). It’s dispelled the Magic Circle, so Xirnaxxsha follows close behind. Between the two of them and Asger, they manage to knock Odo nearly to unconsciousness
    • As Asger continues to rant and rave, demanding the party tell him how they beat him to the mythallar, Nevaeh and Odo recognize a slight Waterdelvian accent in his words
        ◦ Oh he’s Odo’s brother, and based on Odo’s reaction to Kaz’s knowing look, Odo knows it too.
    • Nevaeh summons a celestial spirit to defend us. Xirnaxxsha casts a Firestorm into the main room, striking everyone but Kaz and Zeferio who are sheltering in a nearby hallway.
    • The fight is brutal, and doesn’t go in the Far-Flung Fellowship’s favor. Asger and his lackey “target the cleric!” and wrack Nevaeh with waves of agony. Xirnaxxsha claws and poisons Odo to death. Seeing him fall, the party’s resolve breaks, and they grab his body and flee with Zeferio.
    • Zeferio teleports us to the Agathys/Porphytes portal, which Kaz finds again with the planar sextant. Nev uses her mother’s necklace and her last Channel Divinity to Revivify Odo. Despondent and angry, we make our way back through the series of portals to the Outlands. It’s Eliasus 28th
    • Thinking back, Kaz believes that Xirnaxxsha was some sort of really evil undead, rather than a full fiend. She did have a fiendish influence to her.
        ◦ fungal lich
    • We decide to rest at home and plan our next move. Zeferio comes with us, intending to set out after a hot meal and see Toril for himself. He’s astonished by Sigil and momentarily forgets his grief while he marvels at the city and Kaz describes the Wards on the way to their house.
    • House has a new password to enter: “watchful”. Also, certain types of evil creatures will trigger house defenses (glyphs of warding on the doors)
    • We contact Ganth to see if he can help us with the mythallar, but he says that the Watchful Voyagers are mostly focused on the corrupted celestials, and he doesn’t know how to help us with the mythallar situation. He also says that fiends are always doing evil things, and that, while stealing a mythallar certainly counts, he can’t act without knowing more about what they plan to do with it.
    • Kaz, Odo, and Zeferio head to Silverymoon. Kaz warns Tinkerreach that Asger thinks she’s after the mythallar and may want revenge, and she’s understandably upset with him and with Kaz for being the (indirect) cause of this situation. She resolves to call the Knights In Silver if he shows up
        ◦ she also tells Kaz that Kaz should keep the Conduit, since it’ll be safer with her if Asger does show up in Silverymoon.
        ◦ Kaz also uses Sending to let Angela and her father know that Asger is a vengeful asshole and that she’s worried for them, and wishes them safety.
    • Kaz and Odo wish Zeferio well, and remind him that they still care about him and the world still needs him, and that he can share his story with the world to keep his loved ones remembered. He seems ever so slightly cheered up, and Kaz is less worried that he’s going out to find a place to commit suicide. Before he leaves, she gives him 25 gold to get him started, and tells him that if he’s ever in the High Forest, he should say hello to her dad and listen to his music.
    • Nevaeh and Lana go to the Temple of Selune to pray after the whole Agathys ordeal, then head home to rejoin Kaz and Odo. As they’re getting ready to rest for the night, Jevrin knocks on our door and says Guard Captain Donnely and his guards caught a kenku sneaking around our house. They’re holding the kenku, and will allow us to question them.
    • Before going to bed, Kaz casts Contact Other Plane and tells Exilicor that she didn’t manage to destroy the mythallar and that she’s sorry. They respond “Bad… so far nothing”. She asks them if they know where it is now and they say no. She asks them if she can see through it like before, and they just say “dark”
    • We take a long rest. Lana dreams, and wakes up thinking to herself that Xirnaxxsha seemed to be smelling her and her spores with interest, and almost seemed to recognize Lana.
    • We wake up the morning of 29 Eliasus, two days before the full moon. We decide to interrogate the kenku and try to find out Ranjat’s location so we can assassinate him. We plan to head to the Loop Woods for the full moon after that.
    • We head in to interrogate the kenku, who’s name is Trashwing. Nevaeh casts Zone of Truth on them, and Kaz casts Detect Thoughts before entering the room. Their initial surface level thoughts are “Turdbeak!” Kaz telepathically passes the thought on to Lana, who crouches beside Trashwing. “They don’t call me Turdbeak anymore. I’ve got my own name now”
        ◦ Lana: “What was the rakshasa’s plan for me if he found me at the house?” The kenku refuses to answer, but Kaz digs deep into their thoughts and learns that they were just supposed to find out what was going on and report back
        ◦ Lana: “Where is the rakshasa right now?” Again, they refuse to say. Kaz digs deeper and learns that they don’t know where he is.
        ◦ Lana: “How were you going to report back to the rakshasa?” Kaz pulls out that they were supposed to tell Stinkmaggot, who knows how to contact Ranjat.
        ◦ Lana: “I remember there was another kenku in our family, Stinkmaggot. Where is Stinkmaggot?” The kenku casts a fearful glance at Kaz and tries to think about food, but beneath their surface thoughts they recall the house they’ve been living in within Sigil (probably Hive or Lower Ward, from the glance Kaz gets), though Ranjat lives elsewhere
        ◦ Lana: “When was the last time Ranjat was here in the city?” Trashwing doesn’t directly interact with Ranjat, so they don’t really know his comings and goings.
        ◦ Kaz apologizes for prying into their mind.
    • Nevaeh realizes she can use Twilight Sanctuary to break the charm on Trashwing and does so. They’re relieved. We promise to kill Ranjat and free them and the rest of the kenku. Lana gives them the name Twilight “until they find their own name”
    • Lana asks Twilight about who Ranjat was meeting with and they sign “Devils.” She asks how Ranjat knew she was in Sigil, and Twilight signs “I think he saw you”
        ◦ Kaz assumes Ranjat was in Sigil for the fiend conference.
    • Lana narrows down the location of the safehouse to the Lower Ward and learns that there are 8 kenku there, along with a new Tash’gar even bigger and worse than the old Tash’gar. Kaz asks if there are any kenku left on the rakshasa’s estate, and learns that he brought them all with him (but that several Lana knew had died on jobs before the move). Twilight’s job was to comb the streets looking for Lana.
    • We head down to the Lower Ward, stealthily moving past all the fiends until we find the safehouse. Lana turns to mist and slips through the keyhole, only to find that the door is locked with a key from the inside. Odo busts the door down just as Tash’gar leaps over the balcony and slams into the floor
