Freeing Prisoners
    • We’re looking for Xanthos (missing miner) and Toby (monk warrior of the archaeological expedition).
    • We’re infiltrating the colony through the lower tunnels. There’s a vertical shaft down to the garbage pit that intersects with the tunnels, and it’s likely that we could climb up the shaft from the tunnels into the center of the colony and have access to the mushroom’s lower roots. We’d then stick the mushroom’s root with the spine to cure it and the infected myconids.
    • We’re instructed to go right, left, left, left. We’ll see the walls covered in roots, and we should be able to climb up fairly easily.
    • We make our way through the tunnels. We try to cut an arrow in the mushrooms on the wall pointing back the way we came. This triggers the mushrooms to release spores that prevent us from seeing.
    • Kaz uses a piton to feel the left wall of poisonous mushrooms, knowing that they’ll have to turn left at some point. She takes the lead until she falls down a shaft (the next left). The others shout after her.
    • Kaz slides down and down until the floor disappears beneath her and she falls into the garbage pit. Good news: she left the spores far behind, so she can see her surroundings
    • The rest of the party manages to stop themselves from falling after her. They realize what’s happened and decide to rappel down after Kaz to make sure she’s okay.
      












      
    • Kaz sees a giant insectoid monster chewing on some sort of carapace. She immediately casts invisibility on herself. The monster looks over, doesn’t see her, goes back to eating.
    • Lyesgiel rappels down to Kaz’s “room”
    • Two other person-sized monsters (rust-eaters) crawl out from behind a pile of rusty armor. They seem able to hone in on Kaz somehow. Lyesgiel also appears in the tunnel above around this point, doesn’t understand “be quiet” when Kaz warns him telepathically.










    • Lyesgiel tosses down a rope. Kaz grabs it and Odo and Zuggtboy pull her and Lyesgiel back up the slide tunnel to safety.
    • Kaz tosses a rock to see if the original tunnel continues past the gap. She hears the pebble hit a wall, then fall down the slide tunnel. Lyesgiel casts Speak With Animals, and a cave centipede confirms that the original tunnel caved in a while ago.
    • The party decides to climb up the shaft from the point Kaz found. Kaz and Lyesgiel rappel down above the garbage pit and decide to clean out the monsters in case one of the party falls down into the garbage. Kaz blasts apart the rust monsters, but when she attacks the other insectoid creature, it crawls up the shaft wall and attacks her back.
    • Kaz and Lyesgiel jump down into the shaft, turn around, and shoot the monster. Odo hears them call for help, slides down, and slices the monster in two as he slides by, landing on his feet.
    • The party sees a floating dagger, not angled as if to harm the party. Kaz is curious, creeps closer and uses Mage Hand to try to grab the dagger. Mage Hand bounces off a surface that refracts the light differently than the rest of the air, and Kaz realizes it’s a gelatinous cube. She books it back up the rope to the tunnel above, yelling for the others to follow her.
    • The group climbs from the tunnel up the side of the shaft.
    • Kaz turns Lyesgiel invisible, he sneaks out and stabs the giant mushroom with the spike. It takes a while, but eventually the giant mushroom releases pink spores. The myconids freak out, then go catatonic. The party leaves the trash pit to investigate, but the myconids don’t react.
    • We leave through the main entrance, meet a scout from New Dankseep who guides us back. About a day later, we get confirmation that the Dankseep myconids are restored. Sovereign Panaleus is grateful, rewards us with what surface treasures his colony has found that he thinks might be useful to us.

 The Next Day
    • We wake up the next day and are greeted by Sovereign Panaleus and Sovereign Rusilia, who apologizes for trying to harm us while possessed. She brings us a mushroom tincture that makes a person stronger and better at fighting for a time (potion of heroism), which Odo takes.
    • The myconids guide us toward the drow encampment. Not long after we start travelling, the cavern opens wide and we see enormous wooden trunks topped with mushroom caps. Bioluminescent lichen lines the walls and ceiling, but disappears into the haze around 1,000 feet away. This is the Zirkwood Forest. It’s dark under the trees, but here and there are beams of light passing through the trees.
    • As we walk, a large creature steps out in front of us (15ft long, 8ft wide). beams of lichenlight strike its crystals, turning them pink. The myconids frantically warn us that it is a dangerous creature, and we should keep still. It stalks around us silently, coming right up to us.













    • Kaz hears a voice in her mind say “Are you a drow?” Panicked, she responds honestly (and telepathically) “...No?” It grumbles and after a momenty says “Fine” then turns away.
    • the myconids say that it’s a new creature, which has only appeared within a year or two (we estimate, based on myconid mushroom cycles)
    • We continue forward. Eventually, we see what looks like a giant white canopy reaching up from the zirkwood trees to a stalagtite on the cavern ceiling. Kaz can just see what looks like spiders crawling along it, which must be the size of a car based on their distance away. The mushroom spiders make the mushroom canopy sway as they pass, they’re so large















    • We get closer. Beneath the giant central stalagtite is a hill of stalagmites, on which the camp is situated. Tons of bats are caught in the sticky webbing above.
    • Zuggtboy wildshapes into a bat, flies over the encampment to spy. He sees a drow priestess giving a speech to ~22 drow and 10 quaggoth, but can’t understand the language. He can also see two doorways hollowed out in the stalagmite rock, and estimates that the area behind the doors is the size of a two-story building. A few sentries stand on the mushroom caps around the encampment. There are 4 or 5 giant lizards harnessed, saddled, and hitched to posts between the treeline and the rock stage where the drow is speaking.
    • We make a plan to set a fire as a distraction while we sneak into the stalacmite cave and search for prisoners. Zuggtboy casts Pass Without Trace so we can sneak past the sentries without being caught.
    • As Kaz gets closer, she can hear the priestess saying in Elvish “and when we confront this lizard, remember each of you, cowardice in battle will be punished by serving the favored beast of our queen in the hatchery (the quaggoths gasp).” The drow woman continues to go on about the punishments for cowardice, then tells everyone to disperse. Apparently, the attack on the lizard isn’t happening immediately, so we stick to the original plan
    • Kaz lights a supernatural bonfire at the top of one of the sentry trees. The web is VERY flammable, the whole canopy starts burning and dropping flaming pieces on the camp.
    • as we sneak around to the back entrance, Kaz hears another voice yelling “gazartha!” - clearly a proper name for something, probably Undercommon loan word. Some of the drow start running back into the camp. Like a whale breaching the ocean, a monster explodes from the ground at the center of the camp. It grabs a drow next to it, chops the drow in half with its pincer claws, and dives back into the rock, which ripples and smooths as though nothing had ever breached it.




















    • We sneak between crates and other piles of equipment, heading directly for the cave. We get as close as we can without being seen by the crowd of drow in and around the cave
    • The crystal creature from before runs up and starts attacking the drow, drawing them away from the cave. The priestess starts barking orders at the others to attack the creature. we sneak into the left cave while they’re distracted.
    • corridor runs down 100ft, corridors branching out on either side. one of the side corridors expands into a larger space with a bunch of weapon racks against the right wall. At the end of the hallway, the passage curves sharply and we can’t see what’s beyond.
    • Zuggtboy sees spiderweb curtains covering the side passages. He looks through the left side passage and sees empty sleeping quarters. He sees another small room through the right-hand passage, apparently officer quarters. Both sleeping quarters have beds, chests, and shrines to Lolth.
    • Lyesgiel dashes down to the armory room, sees a single armed drow who looks just as surprised to see him as Lyesgiel was to see the drow. His rabbit ears spring up in surprise.
    • Kaz and Odo run after Lyesgiel and attack the drow. The drow manages to cry out “Surface dwellers!” in Elvish. We quickly kill him and move along.
    • At the very end of the hallway is a barracks to the right and a staircase leading downward to the left. We rush downstairs, Kaz can see humanoids cocooned to the wall with spiderweb, moaning weakly. There are multiple orbs attached to the humanoids, one of the humanoids vomits up tarantula-sized baby giant spiders and dies. We’ve found the spider hatchery, and the people “serving” in it.
    • Spiders swarm Kaz, but she manages to dodge their bites and run back to cover.
    • Most of the humanoids seem to be grimlocks, but one of them is an actual human. Odo recognizes him as Toby, one of the missing humans we went to find.
    • Zuggtboy uses a Sporebeam to start frying the spiders, and Kaz finishes off the swarm with a massive eldritch blast.
    • We cut Toby free of the spiderwebs and slice the spider eggs off of him. Zuggtboy makes a medicine check and realizes that some of the spiders may have already burrowed into him, and realizes he’d need disease-curing magic to heal him properly. He’s too weak to walk at first, so Odo says “you gotta get out of here, you’re gonna be a dad soon!”, dumps a healing potion down his throat and helps him stand.
    • Realizing that they can’t carry out the other prisoners, Kaz does the merciful thing and sets their webbing ablaze, killing them and any remaining spiders.
    • The party heads back up and out. Kaz grabs a set of studded leather armor and a coil of 100ft spider silk rope from the armory on the way.
    • We look outside and see that the drow are still fighting the crystal creature. We also hear battle coming from the front entrance to the silk canopy, and suspect that there’s a second crystal creature fighting more drow. Zuggtboy decides to help this crystal creature and moves his Moon Beam spell onto some of the drow, who immediately cry out “surface dwellers!” as the party runs by. Fortunately, Zuggtboy casts Pass Without Trace again and they soon lose track of us in the chaos of the battle.
    • Kaz passes by a pile of gear meant to outfit drow scouts. She somehow senses some magical power from a backpack in the pile, because all magic has some energy to it. She grabs the backpack
        ◦ Inside the backpack are waterskins and blue spore bread and some ripplebark fungus. Lady Rhydell later identifies the backpack itself as a bag of holding.
    • Zuggtboy tells Kaz to tell “her friend” the crystal creature that we’re there to help. She’s uncomfortable, but thanks the creature and relays the message telepathically. It replies “Well help then!” in her mind.
    • The priestess drow wears ornamental armor and a jeweled circlet with an onyx spider jewel. She carries a symbol of Lolth in one hand, which sends out a streak of green light that hits the crystal creature. The crystal creature collapses, dead. We see the writing on the wall and keep running.
    • We run up to the saddled lizards and Lyesgiel convinces them to carry us away from the drow. The drow can’t miss us climbing onto their lizards, no matter what magic tries to hide us, and they fire at us with poison crossbow bolts. We manage to escape, largely because the drow are suddenly occupied by a large, flying thing somewhere beyond our site line
        ◦ Zuggtboy named his lizard “Roselia” after Sovereign Roselia. Odo named his lizard “High-m-lick.” Kaz named her lizard “Scales”
    • We travel back and eventually reach familiar tunnels. We return with Toby through the archaeological tunnels to the surface. We hear Orenson in a heated debate with a woman in his office, but Blackwood immediately notices us and Toby and immediately has other miners get Toby to the temple and cleric Clarisha Talovir. In the end, it’s Sir Gondrian and his single level of paladin training that cures Toby of his spider parasites.
    • Toby has a tearful, joyful reunion with his wife
    • Gilbert’s door flies open and a female half-orc storms out wearing an armband of the Zhentarim. She says “Fine, don’t employ us! Those who don’t employ the Zhentarim have a habit of falling to the nastiest of enemies.” She glares heavily at Sir Gondrian as she leaves, and he glares back.
        ◦ the Zhentarim are the de facto mercenary guard force of the region

Missing Miner Statuses:
    • Xanthos – still missing, lost with the search party looking for Amwen & Toby who had been exploring the third floor of the cave system when it was first revealed
    • Amwen Regald – killed and assimilated by the Zuggtmoy-influenced myconids
    • Toby – saved!
