    • Brigida expresses that she’s only still with the party because she’s looking for the missing Xanthos
    • we go to the building housing the mine’s entrance. Zuggtboy looks like he’s forgotten something. Kaz asks him about it, and he mumbles “where did I put him…?”
    • Bognar’s shambling corpse suddenly walks around the corner of the mine entrance building. Everyone immediately attacks. The party destroys Bognar before Zuggtboy can explain that he raised the zombie.
        ◦ seeing the party’s/townsfolk’s fear, Zuggtboy pretends he had nothing to do with the zombie. Odo isn’t fooled. Kaz doesn’t want to know. The rest of the party agrees with the guards that “there must be a necromancer afoot!”
    • having solved the zombie problem, we go down into the tunnels with the lizards. Zuggtboy explains that he raised Bognar’s corpse as part of the “circle of life”, and agrees to let the party know before he raises anything else
    • Lyesgiel senses where the underground portal is and points us in the right direction
    • we come to a very wide open room filled with enormous natural stone pillars. The effect is very mazelike. Looks like a heavy wind eroded the tunnels
    • we creep through the tunnels, leaving a breadcrumb trail to guide our way back. eventually, Zuggtboy hears the faint sounds of battle up ahead and stops the party. 
    • Kaz and Lyesgiel creep forward through the tunnels to investigate. The tunnel lightens faintly up ahead
    • Kaz sees lizardlike corpses at the foot of a pillar, and two drow climbing the pillar. A male drow mage in dark spidersilk robes and a female junior priestess in dark studded leather armor both disappear into the wall. Kaz and Lyesigiel hear the two drow having a conversation.
Female: More of those infested. Where are they coming from? At least the myconids have stopped.
Male: Yes…
Female: Well. At least they were easily dispatched.

The two are quiet for a while.
Female: How long before she returns?
Male: Perhaps a couple of cycles. I doubt she’ll stay long in Shavrakyath. Just long enough to convince mother to lend us my brother
Female: You mean…
Male: Yes. Quendar.
Female: Do you think Terzio Voratir’s minions will emerge will return before she returns with reinforcements?
Male: The elementals could stay hidden in that dragon’s lair indefinitely, but the surface dwellers who stole our lizards have to come out eventually.
Female: What does the dragon have?
Male: A rich hoard. We’ll sieze it for House Tuer'derith
Female: You speak like a leader. You’re only a male, you’d do well to remember your place.
Male: Of course, my lady.

    • Kaz recalls that not long ago, when we hit the drow base, we heard the priestess giving a pep talk about “attacking the dragon”, then we attacked and a bunch of creatures attacked at the same time (probably taking advantage of our diversion). Kaz gathers that the attacking creatures were probably the dragon’s minions
    • Kaz returns and relays the info to the group. We decide to try to slip past the guards, hoping to find Xanthos faster. Some motherfucking spider bitch crawls out from behind the drow’s pillar and sounds an alarm.The drow come out from their pillar to join the fight. 
        ◦ In elvish:
          Female: The lizard mounts! There they are! They weren’t in the lair!
          Male: I told you
        ◦ The male drow orders the spiders to spare the lizards. He turns to the woman and says “Ereldra! Leave! Get yourself out of here.” She responds “I’ll inform the others,” and flies off
        ◦ The male drow’s name is Szordrin.
    • The party kills Szordrin and the two spiders. Brigida is nearly beaten unconscious, but stays awake through sheer force of will
        ◦ Kaz gives Brigida a standard healing potion she found on Szordrin, since she’d had a rough time in the fight. Brigida thanks her, then absently remarks “That’s a weird word. ‘Thank you’”
        ◦ Dark Spidersilk Cloak: Kaz has heard about the drow and studied arcana. She knows that the drow manufacture a lot of magic items, and that most of them function around the absence of sunlight. If a drow magic item falls under sunlight, it loses it’s magic
    • Lyesgiel expands their senses and detects aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead within a mile of us. They also reach out for where the portal is located and sense that it’s up ahead through the brighter cavern in front of us, and ~1000 feet down. 
    • We walk into the brighter cavern. The ceiling arches into a huge dome, with a swirling whirlpool of diffuse blue-white light above. The floor drops down like 10 feet, and the walls are covered in the same dead fungus we saw as we approached Dankseep colony. In the cavern’s center, there’s an enormous statue carved in the shape of a claw.
        ◦ Kaz doesn’t recognize the blue-white light, but figures that she could find someone who does. She makes a sketch of the cavern and its ceiling
    • Odo recalls that the whole area used to be completely filled by the great fungus Aramacos, but lots of it died in the past few years when the terribly evil demonic things that attacked Dankseep Colony invaded the area.
    • overhead, a group of batlike creatures flies by. They’re called Sturges, and they stick their probosces into creatures and suck their blood
    • The sturges attack! Odo notices that one has little fungal stalks growing from its head, and isn’t attacking with the others. We slay all the sturges regardless
    • We keep going until we come to a dip in the tunnel. The dip is filled with a pool of dark, turbid water. Brigida goes to step into the water, but hears a voice in her mind telling her not to step in the water because it was diseased.
    • Kaz peers up at the ceiling, can just see a tentacle writhing between the stalactites. She reaches out to it psychically. The creature (a flumph) is friendly, and tells her that the water is part of the defenses surrounding the gem dragon Terzio’s lair. They say that Terzio is generally averse to people passing through his lair, but would be interested to learn about a portal nearby.
        ◦ Kaz knows that gem dragons are rare, and typically fall in between the generally good metallic dragons and generally evil chromatic dragons
        ◦ The rest of the party just sees Kaz silently staring up at the ceiling for several minutes
    • Before Kaz can tell the party about the dragon, the creature cries out in Kaz’s head “Look out!” The party leaps out of the way, just in time to dodge a darrow rock trap crashing down on us. The darrow attack us as the creature runs away to warn Terzio about the darrow
    • The lizards run along the walls to cross the tunnel without touching the water. We see six darrow, three on each side of the tunnel, aiming crossbows at us and shocked that we crossed the water so quickly.
    • We kill three, and the remaining three run away in terror. Brigida runs after the darrow and hits one with a thrown axe, hearing him shout “Help! Help! Intruders! They’ve got wall lizards!”
    • The darrow run right towards a lit cavern ahead. We hear a roar, and suddenly a dragon eclipses the cavern entrance. Spikes float along its body. The small jellyfish creature that Kaz was talking to is floating nearby. 

    • Terzio yells out “How dare you invade my lair! Now you must die!” He opens his jaws and glowing motes of light are sucked towards a large glow at the back of his throat, before the light bursts forth as a blast of force – his singularity breath. 
        ◦ Odo and Brigida have rushed ahead after the darrow. They’re caught in the blast. Odo’s mount dies, and Brigida’s barely survives. The darrow cheer.
    • Kaz and Zuggtboy cry out to Terzio from around the corner, begging him to stop. Kaz shouts out that they have information for Terzio, while Zuggtboy yells that they’d already 
    • Brigida cuts Odo free of his dead mount and drags him back around the corner to reach the rest of the party.
    • Terzio doesn’t immediately keep attacking. Instead, he turns his head as if to address someone else and speaks aloud. “What do you mean? ...They attacked! ...Ugh!”. Kaz realizes he’s talking with the same creature she was telepathically speaking to earlier.
    • Kaz slips cautiously out from around the corner and apologizes on her companion’s behalf. She explains that they hadn’t meant to trespass, and that they hadn’t realized that the darrow were on Terzio’s side. Terzio still seems quite angry that the party killed several darrow, and Kaz offers up her knowledge of the drow’s planned attack as a peace offering. This works well enough that Terzio is willing to hear out what the party wants. 
        ◦ Terzio declares “My ...charges will attend to their wounded.” Kaz nods, and the darrow cautiously move around the party to reach their fallen bretheren.
    • Kaz thanks Terzio for not killing them. She asks that the party be allowed passage through Terzio’s lair in exchange for telling him about a nearby portal. He tells the party they better come inside, and to leave the lizards outside.
    • The lair is amazing, even if slightly damaged. There’s a mosaic on the floor of a star pattern with ten points. There’s a broadly spiralling staircase leading up to a second level, flanked by two damaged statues of mages holding staffs. To our right is a broad doorway with closed metal doors. Behind us is an ornate fireplace. 
        ◦ judging from the decrepitude, the lair is very old. Probably Netherese. The sconces lining the wall are magical flames, with internal flame spells that have probably been there for a long time. A high status individual lived/worked here. The amount of opulence, trim/molding, fine mosaic work all point to wealth. There are echoes of the architectural features we’ve seen excavated above by the expedition, but it’s more intact than what the expedition has found. The fireplace won’t have a chimney going all the way up, so it must be magical too.
    • Two moving stone creatures eye us from the right side of the room. One of the darrow on the stairs studies us as well.
    • Odo offers up the enchanted drow shortsword we found at the drow camp. Terzio takes it as an offering, seemingly pleased.
    • Terzio asks us to introduce ourselves
    • In awe of her surroundings, Kaz asks Terzio what he knows about the ruins he’s made his layer in. He asks Kaz to tell him what she knows. She recounts the history of the Netherese empire, mentions that the area they’re in was part of the Netherese R&D department, and that they were likely researching mythallar spheres. Terzio says that he’d suspected as much. Kaz asks if the Netherese were contacting other planes. Terzio gives her a sharp grin. “Absolutely.” Kaz’s gaze is intense, fully focused on Terzio. “Which ones?” Terzion chuckles. “All of them.” He pauses. “How do you know these things?” Kaz pauses just slightly, terrified to answer but even more terrified to remain silent. Fortunately, Odo and Lyesgiel started winking at each other playfully and derailed the conversation until Zuggtboy remembered to introduce himself as “one of the people who burned down the giant drow encampment”, which distracted Terzio into talking about the drow.
    • Terzio says that our distraction at the drow camp gave him the opportunity to attack the drow camp with his forces (and we remember the flying shape we saw as we fled, assuming it must’ve been him). “Only some of the drow escaped. They did destroy two of my gemstalkers”
    • We ask if there’s a way through Terzio’s lair to reach the portal. He says there isn’t, and points to the sealed metal doors. Through the metal doors are two floors of offices, which Terzio and his people have already looted. The third floor below us is collapsed, but there are definitely more floors below. Aberrations sometimes crawl up from beneath the collapse.
        ◦ Terzio despises aberrations, excluding the little jellyfish creature
        ◦ the jellyfish creature later tells Kaz that they genuinely don’t trust the darrow for always attacking people first, and don’t understand why Terzio trusts them
    • Xanthos recognizes Odo’s voice and calls out to him from the second floor. He’s been imprisoned for trespassing, and is paying his debt by translating for Terzio.
    • We bargain to bring back the treasure from the inaccessible lower floors and give up 70% of it to Terzio’s treasure hoard in exchange for exploring the lower floors and taking Xanthos home. “Since you have aided me against my enemies I shall allow you to come back”
    • We meet Xanthos by passing through an ornate office on the second floor to reach a locked closet where Xanthos sleeps/works. He’s working on an old book that is nonetheless in excellent shape.
        ◦ Xanthos trained with Brigida. She clearly cares deeply for him.
    • On the closet wall is a plaque of the ten pointed star. There’s writing along each point of the star in draconic. Xanthos has made common translations of the plaque, and the “words” seem to be names.
    • Xanthos is babbling excitedly about everything he’s learned translating for Terzio. “The Uvorin Decemvirate was here! This was their laboratory!” - Xanthos
    • Brigida hugs Xanthos tightly, wiping his face with a motherly air. She uses a red cloth with some writing on it.
    • Odo asks Xanthos to keep what he’s seen to himself, rather than immediately telling Gilbert Orenson, since the town has been through so much and he “wants to keep things calm until they have the full story.” Xanthos respects his boss Gilbert, and is very unwilling to withold information from his boss that his boss would be very interested in.
        ◦ Odo brings up the fact that the expedition is very in debt, about 10-15K gold. Xanthos reassures Odo that there were many valuable artifacts that had already been found and sent back to Waterdeep to be sold, making up about half the debt, but they hadn’t found anything in quite a while and the costs of transporting finds and supplies to and from Waterdeep were astronomical.
        ◦ Kaz backs up Odo by suggesting to Xanthos that, if Orenson found out that the treasures he was desperately searching for were in a dragon’s hoard, he might lead a very ill-advised expedition to take on the dragon and recover the treasure. Terzio’s timely appearance and anger at the idea of an invasion helps fully convince Xanthos not to say anything to Gilbert.
    • The names on the star are the names of the Uvorin Decemvirate, which translates to “Far Roaming Ten” – ten arch mages of the Netherese empire. Drosus (the person listed on the star’s top point) was probably the “Chief Scrutinator” – the leader
        ◦ Kaz: Far Roaming Ten? Sounds like planewalking.
          Xanthos: “Clearly” points behind Kaz to multiple solar-system-type models of the planes.
        ◦ Xanthos thinks that his prison room was once the leader’s office. He also thinks that Terzio’s main interest is the multiverse itself, which is what drew him to his lair.
    • We agree to take Xanthos back to the surface, then return to explore the lower levels of Terzio’s lair. As we walk by the drow’s scouting encampment, we see that Szordrin’s body is missing.
