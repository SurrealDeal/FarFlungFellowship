    • Kaz casts Detect Magic during the last few minutes of the short rest
    • We descend the stairs at the end of the room, passing down 7 or 8 flights of a wide spiral staircase made of polished marble. Paradrian doesn’t follow us down. At the bottom is a large, high-ceiling room that looks like a church with rectangular nooks in the wall. In the nooks are carved panels depicting different scenes. In the middle of the room is a pool of perfectly still, clear water with a pedestal of beautiful, ornately carved alabaster statue of an angel with fine, delicate wings. At the far end are three apses in a cloverleaf configuration. Each one has an altar positioned in front of it.
        ◦ Nev isn’t entirely sure the statue is of an angel, but she knows it’s some sort of powerful celestial or perhaps something more than that.
        ◦ Kaz detects a general aura of abjuration magic around the room.
    • Nev and Kaz examine the six wall-sized carved panels around the room. They see that there are captions in celestial beside them. The captions read: the rising, the confrontation, the casting out, the sacrifice, the transformation, and the lasting hope. In the first panel, a central radiant figure faces a crowd of smaller figures looking at them in adoration and awe. The figure seems to be the same as the statue. In the second panel, the same figure strides confidently forward and extends a hand toward a crowd of cowering smaller figures. There is a kind of tear on the other side of the panel with fiendish forms emerging from the tear and surging toward the cowering creatures. In the next panel is a battle, with the angelic form engaged in battle with a terrible demonic force, more or less human-looking. The angelic figure is shown to be greatly wounded while also casting down its opponent. In the next panel, the fiends are retreating but the angelic form is on its knees and propped up by other figures. In the second to last panel, we see the celestial has collapsed into a ball of light, and as the ball dissipates a rod with a spiralling pattern emerges from it. The final panel shows worshippers paying homage at the temple we’re in.
        ◦ Even in Faerun we’ve never seen stonework so skillful as it is in these panels.
        ◦ Nev goes over to one of the altars and starts praying
        ◦ Lana pokes around the panels, but doesn’t find any hidden buttons. She studies the last two panels and realizes that the rod appears to be resting on an altar like the one in the room that Nev is praying in front of.
    • Lana and Kaz discuss how to get the rod out from the altar. Kaz recalls that Alethinos (the god in the carvings) was a god of clarity. Nev suspects that the staff may only appear to those who ask and have great need. Kaz suggests that Nev be the one to ask for the staff, since she’s the most holy and she has the most need (as it’s her father who’s bewitched). She prays at the altar, explaining her situation to anyone who’s listening. When nothing happens immediately, Lana tries praying as well. She gets the sense that there is something listening, and from her recent practice with meditation she hones in on the feeling. She thinks that if we were to all meditate and reach a state where we could contact whatever was listening, we could make our pleas heard.
    • Behind the altar is a compartment with a number of silk cushions intended for meditation. We each take one and sit on the floor around the altar. It takes a bit for the party to settle down enough to stop thinking, but eventually we manage to meditate successfully. We realize that something is here with us, and listening to us. The being asks “Why do you come, and what do you wish?” Kaz says “We believe the multiverse is in great peril. Celestials are not acting correctly, and we fear they’ve gone mad. We hope to use the rod’s power to cure them.” The voice speaks back to Kaz and says “Peril. How so? What peril?” Kaz says “There’s a great war coming. Demons and devils are teaming up to invade the upper planes.” 
    • We see a faintly glowing ghostly apparition – the same figure as the statue – appears before Kaz and study her eyes. This continues for several minutes, as Kaz projects honesty and allows her mind to be read. At last, the figure says “I believe you” and an alabaster rod appears on the altar. It’s got a perfectly geometrical configuration, with a sphere at the top and a cube at the bottom and a spiralling rod between the two. Kaz sees that the rod has a strong magical aura on it.
    • We hear footsteps coming down the stairs. Kaz encourages Nev to hide the staff in the bag of holding, but Nev argues that we were chosen and the temple staff will understand that. Emerging from the bottom of the stairs is a 12ft tall celestial, partially made of metal, with skin of marble or alabaster. It looks at us with blindingly bright glowing eyes and says “Thievery! Surrender at once!” When we don’t immediately surrender, it surges forward and attacks.
        ◦ The creature is named Lorpieriel
    • Nevaeh pleads with Lorpieriel, begging them to understand that we were given the rod, but her pleas fall on deaf ears. Seeing that, Odo says “I think I’m done talking” and goes into a rage, lighting into the powerful arcon with blow after blow from Marcel’s Fang. Lorpieriel looks quite startled, not used to being hacked at quite so ferociously.
    • Lorpieriel continues to attack Odo, who nearly falls unconscious. He manages to knock Lorpieriel’s light sword out of his grip and the sword dissipates. Lorpieriel successfully knocks Odo unconscious, but Lana casts Witherbloom on him, bringing him back to consciousness. The celestial is immune to the spell’s necrotic damage, however.
    • Kaz blasts several holes in its alabaster skin. It looks scary like this, with rage filling its glowing eyes. Odo attacks again, even as Lorpieriel blinds him with heavenly retribution, and takes him down. Anguished, Lorpieriel reaches out to the center of the room towards four statues holding up the room’s vaulted ceiling over the fountain, then he vanishes. The statues animate and begin to attack us. Kaz and Odo smash two of the four to pieces that crumble to the floor, while Lana polymorphs a third into a fly. The fourth guards the stairs leading back up until its brethren fall, then runs forward and tries to weaken Odo. It fails, and Lana thornwhips it over to Odo, Kaz blasts it, and Odo decapitates it
    • Now out of combat, Kaz does her best to clean up what she can of the altar (since the four statues are now chunks of rock littering the floor). She offers up a short prayer of apology for damaging the tranquil space, and senses a knowing response, as if the entity bound here knows that the thing attacking us was disturbed.
    • Kaz cleans up the party with a few quick Prestidigitations so that we’ll look less suspicious to others, then we go back upstairs to the trial chamber. Smutlana casts Pass Without Trace on the group and we silently creep out of the room, past Paradrian and out the front door of the Temple of Clarity. We find ourselves back beneath the silver sky and looking out at the gleaming city of Imperia, city of Tempered Souls below us.
    • Lana takes a quick look around for mushrooms and smells a truffle-like smell coming from just beneath the ground. She digs down and finds a very very dark truffle. She recognizes it as an umbershroom, which grants the ability to cast Darkness centered on oneself if one eats it.
    • Nev casts Planeshift just as Lana finishes digging up the mushroom and several arcons exit the temple and look around. We reappear in Brin’s Haven.
