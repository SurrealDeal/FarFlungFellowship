    • We try to scry on Zeferio again. This time, Kaz draws a picture of him to make the scrying a little easier. Despite trying every day (and several nat 1 rolls), the spell never succeeds.
        ◦ possible reasons for failure: Zeferio is on another plane or unscryable
    • Kaz casts Sending to let the WV know about the peace conference, where it is, and that the party will be attending. Torbold says to be careful if the VS are there. Kaz asks if there’s anything in particular to be careful of, and Torbold replies that Lord Querial and the Hunters (who are specifically looking for the Watchful Voyagers) are the most dangerous, and we should  hide our affiliation to the WV.
    • We have a great trip. We get to know Lady Renalia, her niece Eloudra, and Nilica (who’s sharing Lady Renalia’s suite). Midway through the trip, we get a Sending that Ganth has woken up. He’s still weak and can’t use magic, but we send him our best wishes.
        ◦ Lady Renalia asks Nev how she and the Captain are doing. Nev, who’s enjoyed some time with the Captain on this trip, says she thinks things are going better between them. Lady Renalia explains that, in her eyes, men are idiots. She takes her husband Vorra as an example. He’s hunting a planar wild boar in the Outlands as we’re on our trip. He hunts with a spear, and comes back from each hunt horribly injured. It’s clear to her that the Captain loves Nev, but he is also reluctant and kind of an idiot.
        ◦ Odo and Foeslayer get the chance to drink and be merry, as they’d promised each other they would
        ◦ Kaz and Nev spend a large part of the trip planning their costumes for the masquerade.
        ◦ We get tethered to the ship and “bungee jump” in the gravity well. We also land on several asteroids to have fun (and Kaz practices riding)
    • We’re told that the first three days of conference will cover issues of tension and conflict between various orgs. After that’s resolved, they’ll turn to outside issues including fiendish incursions into various different worlds. We’re expected to keep a low profile at the conference, to avoid becoming famous. Lady Renalia will be arranging meetings, and we’ll be meeting people when it’s okay to do so. 
        ◦ There will be a masquerade costume ball on the third day of the conference, and we’re allowed to participate!
    • We get home late on the evening of the 9th. Willow and Twilight are playing hacky-sack in the back alley with the neighborhood kids. They’re apparently great friends. We all head out to buy costumes in the evening.
    • The next morning, we meet Lady Renalia and hop into a horse-drawn carriage with her to go to Yunethra Pacifera’s estate on Wyrmwatch Ave. Nilica, Linessia, Raif Donlee, and Jeverin have all come as well. The Pacifera Estate is HUGE. It covers two city blocks, with two arched bridges stretching over the street so people can go from one side of the estate to the other. It’s 8 stories tall, with parts that stretch to 11 stories. Much of it is titan-sized. Each delegation has been given its own set of guest rooms, and the courtyard is filled with tents made of rich fabric where each delegation can rest and meet with their own delegates.
        ◦ Lady Renalia is representing her own interests as a major philanthropist of good-aligned organizations.
        ◦ Raif found out that his best men had attacked Lady Renalia, because they were from the Harmonium and were mad at her. He immediately tried to resign and Lady Renalia immediately refused, so he’s looking determined to prove himself as her personal guard. He and Odo talk strategy about defending the Lady from the Harmonium and other threats on this trip.
        ◦ For security, we don’t know too much about the specific defenses in the estate, but we assume there are magical defenses in place. Lady Yunethra’s guard corp is entirely made up of storm giant eldritch knights (fighters who learn some arcane magic. No patron)
    • We step into an opulent entry chamber and are guided through the estate. Each staircase has steps for medium creatures, large creatures, and huge creatures. We cross over one of the bridges until we reach Yunethra’s waiting chambers. She’s seated across the room, and it’s like approaching the Lincoln Memorial. 
    • Yunethra doesn’t look elderly, but it’s clear that she’s getting on in years from her demeanor. We’re raised on a magical platform so that we can speak face-to-face. She excitedly greets Lady Renalia, and we’re welcomed to the estate.
    • Lady Renalia’s chambers have a beautifully painted screen to one side, which we’ll hide behind until and unless we’re needed. Kaz makes a set of signals with Lady Renalia so that she can summon us or tell us to remain hidden without alerting guests.
    • Every delegate has to sign in. We sign beneath Lady Renalia’s signature, and she turns the page so that new signatories won’t see our names. By signing, we’re agreeing to a code of conduct that we won’t impugn the character or veracity of any delegate, we won’t start fights, etc. Kaz wants to sign it “Kaz Planewalker” but Lady Renalia insists that she has to sign with her real name. Odo signs his name as illegibly as possible.
    • We watch other delegates enter the estate and pass below us from an obscured balcony in the ballroom. There are many angels and celestials, as well as a variety of mortals. We’ll have to be discreet around the celestials. The Harmonium, the Guardians, the Order of the Planes Militant, and other groups we saw in Arcadia. Overall, the atmosphere is quite festive.
        ◦ Kaz spies Braddius Dickson among the Harmonium delegation. Lana recognizes one of the Order of the Planes Militant delegation as the guy condemning laughter as an expression of chaos in Yeoman in Bytopia. We see Chiprick and his contingent arrive with the Guardians delegation, which is surprising given that they didn’t seem all that high up when we met them in Arcadia.
        ◦ The Harmonium and the Order of the Planes Militant both look uptight, and seem to be eyeing each other and avoiding each other.
    • The Vigilant Sentinels, led by the Deva Lord Querial and the goliath Athelkara, arrive to the meeting as well. The guard commander of the Sigil chapter arrives as well. Lana sees another man wearing a pin with the symbol of a shield being cleft in two (symbol on the banner hanging from the Watchful Voyager’s old tower)
    • The rest of the day is devoted to meet-and-greet sessions. We hide behind the screen in Lady Renalia’s parlor as she holds meetings. The first few meetings are irrelevant. A few members of the Guardians, including an Ursinal (celestial bear person), come to discuss things with Lady Renalia.
    • Athelkara, Lord Querial, and a few other Vigilant Sentinels arrive. Querial is a soft-spoken individual, who sounds very empathetic. He thanks her for everything she’s done and they leave (Athelkara just nods along). Nothing seems out of the ordinary, and we’re baffled that such a beautiful, angelic celestial could be corrupted.
    • A few githzerai arrive. Anarch Acknezir and his fellow delegate start up a pleasant conversation, but the Anarch keeps looking over at the screen we’re hiding behind. Kaz realizes what’s happening just as he stands up, walks purposefully behind the screen as Lady Renalia protests, looks directly at Kaz, and reaches for a secret blade. She draws back nervously, proclaiming that she’s not a threat and showing off her jade bracelet from the githzerai in Limbo.
    • He demands to know why Kaz smells like illithid and the Far Realm. Kaz explains that she got blasted by energy from the Far Realm, but doesn’t like or have anything to do with illithids. She manages to convince him not to attack her, with some help from Odo. The anarch explains that he has spent years fighting the illithid. They bring things from beyond, things of great evil, that all smell like she does. 
    • Kaz shares what she knows about the Far Realm, but doesn’t know of any specific planar crossings that the illithid use to reach the other planes. The Anarch is thoughtful. “There may be no doorways to that place, but Prince Lyrion of the Triton of the Plane of Water says that the abboleth also draw power from that plane, and that they may have a doorway to that plane.”
    • We meet Prince Lyrion later in the day. He’s very regal and stately, and makes very formal introductions. “I was told that I shouldn’t be alarmed by the… smell” Kaz, grimacing: “That would be appreciated”
    • He knows that Kaz is a planar scholar (“aye, that’s why I smell weird”) and asks what she knows about aboleths since his principality is at war with them. She knows that they’re ancient (they claim to have existed before the gods came), linked to the Far Realm, they worship deities out there, that they’re aquatic worm-like eldritch horrors, and they can be very powerful. He knows that they have a secret temple through which they draw hideous monstrosities from the Far Realm, though he’s not sure if they use a portal or some other means. He also knows where the temple is, though giving directions through a featureless plane of water would be very challenging, so Kaz doesn’t bother to ask where it is. He does say that he’d welcome the party’s help in the war.
    • We meet with many other delegates throughout the day. Lady Renalia calls us out for a few of these meetings. She shares that she’s concerned about the potential for some of these groups to be infiltrated, but wants to discuss it on the fourth day of the conference. Odo sees Lady Theolana Rhydell with the Harpers delegation and runs out to greet her enthusiastically, to everyone’s complete shock.
        ◦ Lady Rhydell explains that demons have once again infused the Underdark, and some have made it to the surface. Kaz suggests that the demons may have been put there as part of some sort of power struggle, and that the remaining demons in the Abyss might be united under a single cause
        ◦ She also tells us that Resorodrath has a very deep grudge against “four treasure-hunting adventurers” and has a reward out for us. She recommends we avoid the whole area.
    • At the end of the day, Lady Renalia summons us to the roof. We look up across the torus and see colorful lights filling the guild hall district. Lady Renalia tells us that every 3 months for 3 days, the Festival of Harmony is celebrated. It’s meant to encourage peace between neighbors. We’ll be able to see the fireworks (set off for the final night, which is tomorrow) from our vantage point. We thank her and head home to sleep.
    • The second day is fairly relaxed for us. Lady Renalia attends three working groups with Commander Donely (smuggling, planar territory shifting, and traitors in good organizations), and we’re left to our own devices. Kaz tests whether she can cast Dimension Door and learns that she can do so. Lana talks to the local fauna and convinces one of Sigil’s Executioner’s Ravens to spy on what the celestials are doing.
    • Kaz also returns to her balcony to people-watch above the courtyard. The atmosphere is pretty genial overall, though she doesn’t see any of the Harmonium in conversation with the Order of the Planes Militant. A few of the groups in Bytopia are also avoiding the OPM, since the OPM has been stealing territory in Bytopia for Mt Celestia.
        ◦ Thick smog has rolled into the Lady’s Ward from the Lower Ward, which is not uncommon, and Kaz hopes it clears so she can see the fireworks that night (since Sigil’s weather can’t be affected by spellcasters, so Lana couldn’t blow it away).
    • Lady Renalia looks a bit exhausted from her day when she returns. “I will say that they came as close as possible to ‘impugning the character and veracity’ of one of the conference attendees. Namely me.” Lana correctly guesses that she’s referring to the Harmonium. Lady Renalia admits that their accusations of her stealing weapons from Arcadia despite their export ban are true, but complains that they were quite rude about it.
    • We happily watch the spectacular fireworks show (they appear to shoot down at us), before heading home for the evening. Nev casts Sending to ask the Captain to attend the masquerade with her. There’s a pause, before he thanks her for the invite and agrees to go with her. Lana meditates to speak with her spore symbiote, and learns that it’s from a dark, cold, rocky place that’s FAR, FAR away and was somehow brought to our world.
    • We don’t go to the conference the next day, because we’re not needed. Nev goes on a walk through the Market Ward and sees that some of the stores are damaged. She talks to several shop owners and learns that there was a raucous protest march that came from the Hive and looped through the streets. No one really knows what they want, because the only thing they call out are anarchist and chaotic slogans like “burn it down!” One person whispers to her “You know, I’ve seen some of them wearing what looks like a Doom Guard symbol. You didn’t hear it from me”
    • We dress up and walk from the intracity portal outside Lady Renalia’s estate to Lady Yunethra’s estate. Cpt Cloudsilver is wearing a costume themed like an Astral Dragon, with shimmering blue, silver, and gold fabrics.
        ◦ Kaz’s costume (she’s also wearing a lot of perfume to hide the ozone smell, even though only githzerai would probably notice it)
        ◦ Nev’s costume (“full Valkyrie/Grecian with a feather headdress”)
        ◦ Lana’s costume
        ◦ Odo’s costume
    • We give our real names to the door guard and head into the ballroom. There are hundreds of people wearing truly spectacular costumes dancing or sitting off to the side. Lady Renalia, Nilica, and Raif are off to the side. Raif is wearing his dress uniform and a plain mask. Lady Renalia is wearing an Eilistraee themed costume. It has silver, deep purple, and midnight blue fabrics with intricate silver embroidery to look like stars. Her mask is a shimmering silver filigree that covers half her face.
    • Kaz decides to enjoy a dance or two. She walks up to the first person she sees – a young man in a silver robe and mask, standing stock still and watching people dance – and invites him to dance with her. He accepts, and they chat amiably as they dance. He’s from Melodium in Arcadia, and has come with the Harmonium delegation. Kaz very successfully lies and says she’s part of the Harmonium delegation.
    • Lana grabs a bite to eat and listens in on nearby conversations. Two women nearby compliment Lana on her costume. “Look at that marvelous costume that she has! It’s like she’s made of her costume! It must be magic” She sees Lord Querial come in and put on his mask, which is shaped like a sun. He’s wearing a golden cloak, and he dances gracefully with another celestial. She doesn’t notice anyone acting suspicious, though there are a few wallflowers (probably the more lawful types who don’t enjoy dancing as much)
        ◦ It’s very unusual to see so many celestials and mortals intermingling
    • As Nev and the Captain cross the room, Nev sees a 2ft tall knight in plate mail. It’s Chiprick, and he recognizes Nevaeh and flags her down. They chat for a bit, and Nev offers him a dance later.
    • Odo snacks on the food, checks for convenient exits, and listens to nearby conversations. He hears that the delegates drafted a statement of unity to support each other, but one delegate glumly says that “it’s just words” and seems to doubt that anyone will hold to the agreement.
    • Lana joins Kaz on the dance floor after a bit. Renalia dances with Nilica in between dances with other people. Priestess Asara is at the ball as well. Her costume has a moonlit forest theme, with green leafy patterns and silver filigree. 
    • Kaz agrees to watch Lady Renalia’s back so that Raif can dance with his wife (the priestess), only for Lady Renalia to draw her into a dance. She takes the opportunity to talk about the conference, and says she was accused of things that won’t help her business, but that overall the conference was a success and that the real work begins tomorrow.
        ◦ The same people were making the same accusations
    • Odo spies Lady Theolana Rhydell and has a dance with her. He’s a passable dancer, and she’s not very talkative. Kaz finishes her dance with Lady Renalia, who goes to sit down as Raif returns from his dance.
    • We hear a chime and Yunethra Pacifera, her consort, and some of her group descend from the balcony and join the ball. People clear a path for them to dance in the middle. The storm giants can Reduce themselves to get into medium creature areas, and they Reduce the titans so that they can dance with other guests. Nev asks them to do the same for her so that she can dance with Chiprick.
    • The ball continues for a while. Kaz listens for some gossip and overhears a few Harmonium members talking about their plans for the next day – reopening some clause in the statement that was put out. She hears similar conversations around the room, of people disagreeing on minor points of the statement. She also hears people eager to start the discussions the next day, since they’re worried about all the chaos in the Lower Planes and suspicious that fiends are causing it.
    • Cpt Cloudsilver finally asks Nev to dance. He’s quiet initially, but then apologizes for being unable to dance the last time she asked. He explains that he “has a past that leads him to avoid becoming too close to anyone such as yourself.” Nev tries really hard not to cry, and he continues “I believe you may have heard some of it from the Lady Renalia?” Nev confirms that she “may have said a few things.” The Captain explains that right after he left home, he was seduced by the Astral pirate Morgana and had a lengthy love affair with her before he finally decided to leave. She didn’t want to let him go and swore that he’d never find love. He met someone, and right as he was ready to find happiness with them, she slew Cpt Cloudsilver’s partner before his eyes. She had a Nabassu demon consume his fiancee’s soul and swore that if he ever found himself in love again, she’d kill that lover too. Nev can tell that relaying the story is triggering a bit of PTSD, though he’s determined to share the tale with her.
    • Odo sees Priestess Asara pass him by. Moments later, Nilica comes up to him and asks if he’s seen Raif Donely, since Asara had just tripped and injured herself. Odo is suspicious, but Nilica seems totally honest. He spots Raif beside Lady Renalia on the dance floor, and Raif, Lady Renalia, and Odo both head across the bridge to where Nilica says Asara is waiting.
    • Asara has clearly hurt her leg. Raif runs over to her. There’s another person next to Asara. Linessia runs up to Lady Renalia and whispers something in her ear. She looks shocked and says that she needs to go to one of the conference rooms for some sort of urgent business. Lady Renalia asks Odo to stay with Asara and Raif, apologizes that Asara got hurt, and rushes off with Linessia.
    • Asara asks Odo to go get her spellcasting focus from the coat check room so that she can heal herself. As Odo runs across the ballroom, Lana intercepts him and asks what’s happening. Odo explains what’s happened and directs her to Asara. Asara is being healed by other clerics by the time Lana arrives, and Lana manages to reset her twisted ankle. She thanks everyone for their help. Odo forgot to ask what her focus is, so he’s rebuffed at the coat room.
        ◦ Kaz intercepts the group as they come back down the stairs, learned what has happened, and  stayed to chat with Asara
    • Everyone returns to the dance floor. Nev and the Captain are still dancing when he suddenly tilts his head to the side and asks her “did you hear that?” Nev doesn’t hear anything, but Smutlana does – a faint, plaintive scream, coming from the other side of the bridge. It sounds like someone is in serious distress.
    • Lana tells Kaz about the scream, and both start moving upstairs rapidly. They come across Odo on his way back from the coat check. Nev and the Captain start upstairs as well, they all meet up by the bridge, and continue forward.
    • We can tell the screams are coming from Lady Renalia’s parlor room. We rush in and are greeted by a grisly scene. Lady Renalia is fully dead, and blood is everywhere. Nilica has just stabbed Linessia either unconscious or dead. She turns to us, covered in blood, points at Linessia, and screams out “She killed her!”
        ◦ Kaz thinks Nilica is being totally truthful. She takes in the scene with an analytical eye. Her initial impression is that a long dagger or short sword to kill Linessia/knock Linessia unconscious. The weapon is currently sticking out of Linessia’s chest, and it’s the only one in the room, so it was probably also used to kill Lady Renalia.
        ◦ Slicing through someone’s throat like the way Lady Renalia was killed isn’t easy to do, and Linessia probably wouldn’t be capable of it. Renalia doesn’t have other injuries, and neither does Linessia
    • Kaz checks Linessia over, finds out that she’s alive, and makes Linessia into her Thrall. Nev runs over to Lady Renalia’s body and casts Revivify, but it fails and we gather that she’s been dead for longer than a minute. She casts Silence to keep anyone from overhearing what’s happening.
    • Lana pulls Odo and a panicking Raif out of the Silence spell and get them to guard the door.
    • Nev casts True Seeing, doesn’t see anything amiss in the parlor, and leaves the room to look for anything suspicious in the halls. Kaz gets her to drop the Silence spell and cleans Lady Renalia’s blood off of her before she leaves.
    • Nev doesn’t see anything amiss in the courtyard, so she heads into the ballroom. She sees Lady Theolana’s silver dragon form, and also sees Lord Querial dancing. She decides to dance with him to try to get information. He tells her his name, and his position as the head of the Vigilant Sentinels. She tells him her real first name, but lies about her family name. He probably detects it? But he doesn’t say anything, merely leaves at the end of the dance and brushes something invisible off his wings.
        ◦ After her dance, Nevaeh hears a vaguely familiar voice in her head: "Why did you dance with Quiriel?  That was very dangerous.  You were warned to stay away from him." She doesn’t recognize the speaker, but can tell that the voice is masculine and probably human (perhaps a WV plant among the VS?)
    • Nilica glares contantly at Linessia. Kaz thanks her for taking care of the problem and reassures her that she’s going to investigate and get to the bottom of this. Linessia looks overwhelmed, sad about what’s happened, and guilty that she couldn’t do anything to stop it. Kaz doesn’t get the sense that she believes she’s responsible.
    • Kaz gets Nilica’s side of the story. Nilica says that she came in to find Linessia holding the blade and standing over Lady Renalia’s body, and assumed she’d committed the crime.
    • Kaz turns to Linessia and asks her what happened. She says that Kaz won’t believe her, but Kaz asks her to tell her anyway. Linessia says she was mind controlled, but she didn’t kill Lady Renalia. She was instead sent to get Lady Renalia. “It made me say that we had an urgent need to talk to-” she lists some business-related people and things that sound plausible, and that John doesn’t feel like describing. Once she was in the room, the voice told her to leave. Linessia walked away, felt the spell end, ran back to check on Lady Renalia, and found her dead. She pulled out the sword and was about to scream when Nilica came in.
        ◦ Linessia estimates that it was about 5 minutes between when she was forced to leave the parlor and when she ran back in.
        ◦ Kaz asks who else would have known about the buisness-related shit that Linessia said she was forced to say. Linessia says she was forced to come up with an excuse, so that’s a dead end.
        ◦ Kaz asks if Linessia saw anyone leave the room once she was running back, or heard the door open. Linessia says she didn’t. She casts Warp Sense and can’t detect any portals in the room. She also can’t find any secret passages into the room, and the guard captain tells her there are no secret ways in or out of the room. The killer probably just left before Linessia returned.
    • Smutlana and Raif leave to find a cleric who can perform a Raise Dead spell. Lana asks who Lady Renalia would trust, and Raif recommends Yunethra. Lana and Raif draw Yunethra off the dance floor and quietly explain the situation. Yunethra summons a cleric of Pelor to Raise Dead and locks the doors, but allows the dancing to continue.
    • Kaz continues her investigation. She notes that nothing in the room was knocked over and no papers are askew, further indicating that there was no struggle. She recalls that Linessia was still under mind control when she left, so it’s unlikely (but not impossible) that Lady Renalia was mind controlled into staying still while she was killed. To Kaz, it seems more likely that Lady Renalia knew and trusted her attacker.
    • Smutlana and Raif return with the cleric, who looks shaken by the death but immediately starts casting Raise Dead (it takes 1 hr). The storm giant guard captain introduces himself and begins his own investigation.
    • Kaz asks Cpt Cloudsilver for his take on the situation. He says that he doesn’t think either of them did it, and Kaz agrees. She continues to investigate.
        ◦ Kaz casts Detect Magic. She sees nothing but the necromantic magic around Lady Renalia and her own weird “generic, school-less magic” surrounding Linessia
        ◦ Kaz casts Detect Thoughts and probes deeply into Linessia’s mind. She’s thinking about the current circumstances, unsurprisingly, and has a memory trace of the whole event and how it played out. Her thought trace matches what she’s been telling us. Kaz gets the impression that something did cast a spell on Linessia, and that it was probably something she’d call Dominate Monster (NOT Dominate Person, this is more powerful and lasts longer). Kaz thinks it was a powerful spellcaster that did this.
            ▪ If it’s really Dominate Monster, it’s possible to cast from range.
        ◦ Kaz asks if Linessia would recognize the mental voice if she heard it again. Linessia thinks the voice was disguised, because it sounded like her own thoughts but louder. (LIKE WHEN KAZ CONTACTS EXILICOR?? Or is that just because John frequently describes mental contact like that, like with Lana’s spores?)
    • Yunethra stops the dancing and says that her dear friend has suffered an attack and that the attacker could still be at the party. She tells everyone to continue to enjoy the party, and murmurs erupt around the room. We’re allowed to stay at the crime scene, but everyone else is escorted out of our wing of the building.
    • Chiprick notices Nev staring at Lord Querial. He says that he saw Lord Querial acting strangely in the “Refreshening Room” earlier in the evening. He saw Lord Querial cleaning his feathers in  one of the room’s cubicles, and wonders what he could possibly have spilled on them since they looked so clean.
        ◦ The Refreshening Room is a room for celestials to purify themselves after interacting with mortals. Mortals aren’t allowed in the room.
    • The Raise Dead spell completes and immediately fails. The cleric cries out fearfully that Lady Renalia’s soul is not available for resurrection.
        ◦ Kaz thinks her soul might be trapped in a Soul Cage, but can’t be sure. IF she’s trapped by Soul Cage, only a Warlock or Wizard could cast it. She could also be trapped by some other, even more fucked-up means that Kaz doesn’t know about.
    • One of the Sons of Mercy runs into the ballroom and drops to one knee. He lets Lady Yunethra know that their lines have been broken in three places and rioters are approaching. A moment later, there’s a huge explosion and part of the ceiling collapses. The guard yells out “they have siege weapons!”
    • Angels spread their wings (including Lord Querial) and fly out to meet the chanting rioters head on. The other guests run for the exits.





Kaz’s main plan in destroying the Conduit is to find where it was made and perhaps discover how to destroy it that way.

If Kaz ever loses her journal, her ceremony to get it back will be drawing a picture of the journal, surrounded by all the symbols etched onto the face of the Conduit. At the end of the ritual, the paper will disappear and the book will appear in its place

Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/01/2023 6:11 PM
(Was the sword totally bloody? I know it had no symbols and wasn't magic, and I assume it was totally covered in blood)

After the resurrection ritual failed, the order was given for the body to be brought to the residence to lie in state until she can retuned to her house. Nilica went to stay with her.  Linessia and Nilica seem to have forgiven one another and have started to discuss what to do and how to tell Vorah.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/01/2023 7:39 PM
Kaz is visibly relieved by their reconciliation, and asks that the body be guarded by either Lady Renalia's staff or Lady Yunethra's until it's returned
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/01/2023 7:41 PM
(Has Rafe been told yet?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/01/2023 7:41 PM

Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/01/2023 7:41 PM
(That Lady Renalia is dead? He was with us when we found her body)

Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/01/2023 7:43 PM
(I didn't mean Asara, I 100% forgot he was there. But I do want to know what happened with her, cuz she was clearly a distraction. Unintentionally, I think.)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/01/2023 7:43 PM
(Agreed.)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/01/2023 7:48 PM
(Sidenote, I'm looking forward to our sidequest of killing this Morgana pirate chick. Because I am definitely going to suggest it. Some battles on the open astral sea sounds fun.)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/01/2023 7:48 PM
(HELL yeah)
(you could lure her in by proposing to the Captain 😏)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/01/2023 7:48 PM
(100% thought about staging a wedding)
(Have a party where we're the ones making evil plans for a change)
John Dungeon Master — 05/01/2023 7:50 PM
(good luck)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/01/2023 7:51 PM
I'm going to take that as a
and not a (gif of a man crossing himself, looking scared)
John Dungeon Master — 05/01/2023 7:52 PM
So, I'm going to wait and see if @Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper wants to do anything with that plant
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/01/2023 7:53 PM
Before he gets back, does anyone in the party recognize which organization might use shortswords/daggers like the one that killed Lady Renalia?
John Dungeon Master — 05/01/2023 7:58 PM
(it's pretty basic. It could have come from anywhere. the guards have taken it for safekeeping.)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/01/2023 8:47 PM
(is it sharp? like...recently sharpened? or kinda dull?)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/01/2023 9:28 PM
Smutlana wants to talk with plants: “tell me, little one, what happened here? Who or what attacked lady renalia? What happened after Linessia left the room?”
John Dungeon Master — 05/01/2023 9:32 PM
(After a bit of back and forth where you explain what you’re talking about because it doesn’t really know peoples’ names, it can tell you that after the one drow left, a white cloak-wearing person, hood up, appeared out of nowhere, killed the other drow, then disappeared.)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/01/2023 9:38 PM
(Details on height, weight, stature, smell? Can the plant give any details on those things?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/01/2023 9:41 PM
It was pretty tall. Like much taller than the drow, and the cloak covered it up but it was kind of lumpy in the back
(There wasn’t really a smell)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/01/2023 9:45 PM
Did it kill her with the knife?
John Dungeon Master — 05/01/2023 9:46 PM
Yes
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/01/2023 9:46 PM
Could it see any other features of the killer's costume?
John Dungeon Master — 05/01/2023 9:46 PM
Just the white cloak
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/01/2023 9:47 PM
Did the drow say anything to the figure before it killed her?
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/01/2023 10:43 PM
After the cutting, did the plant see anything else? Specifically we’re trying to ascertain if there was an explicit soul snatching
John Dungeon Master — 05/02/2023 6:29 PM
So the plant tells you that the person had their back turned to the plant and so after the murder it wasn’t clear what happened
There was no speech, just immediate murder, the plant was quite traumatized
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/02/2023 6:31 PM
Poor plant
Were the lumps on its back large like wings, in the middle like spines, or lower down like a tail? 
John Dungeon Master — 05/02/2023 6:33 PM
Large, one on each side
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/02/2023 6:33 PM
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/02/2023 6:34 PM
(Someone give the plant a hug for me, with consent)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/02/2023 6:37 PM
Kaz would ask the guards if it’s possible to teleport into the estate from the outside
John Dungeon Master — 05/02/2023 7:35 PM
Jarrow Oakrest, the storm giant comes back in the room and says, “not from outside, no.” Then he says I’ve just been told there is a commotion outside. We need to seal this area off. I must ask that you all proceed to the ballroom”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/02/2023 7:49 PM
Kaz stands, removes the blood from her costume with a flick of her hand, and follows Jarrow to the ballroom.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/02/2023 8:02 PM
(Does the Captain get to perform some rolls while they're in that room to see if he can come up with anything we missed? I'm not sure how that works)
John Dungeon Master — 05/02/2023 10:03 PM
Go ahead and roll a d20 for him
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/02/2023 10:03 PM
oh no, my dice are the worst.
(16)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/02/2023 10:25 PM
(Presumably there are more people investigating not just him tho right)
John Dungeon Master — 05/02/2023 10:35 PM
He says, “we haven’t found any physical evidence, and there was an eye witness but it can’t identify the killer. Who had the motive and the opportunity?” 
“The Harmonium surely, but murder isn’t their style”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/02/2023 10:43 PM
Kaz raises an eyebrow, surprised to hear that the Harmonium aren’t the murderous type. “The killer is a powerful spellcaster. In addition to Dominating Linessia, they must have teleported into and out of the parlor room from within the estate. If they used Dimension Door, they’d have had to be within 500 ft of the parlor. What areas does that encompass?”
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:03 PM
(Most of the house including the whole ballroom)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/03/2023 8:17 PM
She frowns, glancing sidelong at the Captain. "Given the height, apparent wings, and their presence in the house, it may be a celestial who killed Lady Renalia" she says telepathically, to him and to the rest of the party 
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:18 PM
(So at this point you’re all heading to the ballroom)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/03/2023 8:19 PM
(Do we hear any commotion yet?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:20 PM
(We went back in time a few minutes)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/03/2023 8:20 PM
(Yeah, I had a few mins running around while you all were doing that)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:22 PM
Asara runs up to Nevaeh and says “Oh, Nev, do you know where Rafe is? I can’t find him, or Lady Renalia…” She looks very concerned. 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/03/2023 8:22 PM
(Where's Nev at this moment?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:22 PM
(In the ball room)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/03/2023 8:23 PM
( I mean, is this right after my dance with lord Q?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:23 PM
(Yes and you just heard a telepathic voice in your head)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/03/2023 8:23 PM
(kk got it)
(before the place caves in and i push chiprick against the wall)
"Oh, priestess, uh...."
(Nev didn't see the stuff with Asara hurting herself I don't think, so she wouldn't know to ask if she's looking okay?)
(Or I guess, what would she see, how does she look at the moment)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:27 PM
(She looks fine just visibly worried)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/03/2023 8:28 PM
Nev looks panicked because she just heard that voice but also isn't sure how to break the news to Asara so she says "I can show you. He'll need you."
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/03/2023 8:41 PM
(So after the murder, the knife was dropped and then Linessia came and picked it up? Or did Nilica pick it up?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:42 PM
(Linessia picked it up)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/03/2023 8:43 PM
(So you slasher showed up with dagger, slashed LR, disappeared and dropped it? )
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:43 PM
(Well presumably dropped it then disappeared)
(By the way, Rafe left to go with the drow women to guard lady Renalia’s remains)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/03/2023 8:43 PM
(So the plan is to guard the remains where they are, and not to move them somewhere?)
(Put them on a stretcher, etc?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:44 PM
(They were moved to the residence on Yunethra’s instructions) 
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/03/2023 8:44 PM
Oh right, so they’re in a separate room indoors, guarded
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:45 PM
(Yes)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/03/2023 8:59 PM
(I don't think Nev knows they moved the body cuz she left before that)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 8:59 PM
(Right)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/03/2023 10:11 PM
(Do we have any idea why Lady Renalia's soul might not be available for Raise Dead? Like, Kaz knows that Soul Cage is a possibility, but are there any other means of trapping or destroying a soul so that the person couldn't be raised?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 10:41 PM
(Well, Nev did just learn one way from the captain)
(If anyone wants to roll religion or arcana to think of other ways go ahead)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/03/2023 10:43 PM
(16)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/03/2023 10:51 PM
(Sorry, Nev learned something about what could have happened to her soul?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/03/2023 10:51 PM
(Souls that have made it to the plane of their afterlife may sometimes be prevented from leaving by powers. It would probably be too soon for that in this case. Souls can sometimes be annihilated. The captain mentioned his fiancé’s soul was consumed by a Nabassu demon)
(Another way would be if the soul became an incorporeal undead creature like a ghost)
(I think those are the only ideas you would likely think of)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/03/2023 10:55 PM
(Ohhh gotcha, thank you)
(Where do drow go when they die?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/03/2023 11:03 PM
(I mean, Lady Renalia would probably go to Eilistraee's afterlife, but idk where that is)
John Dungeon Master — 05/04/2023 12:15 AM
Right, it depends on their deity
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 5:39 PM
(Okay, so Nev has impetuously gone off with true sight to find shit, found lord Q and danced with him, Asara came up to her right after to ask about Rafe and Lady R, and then is it this moment when the rest of the group is going to be entering the ballroom? We went back in time a bit so just making sure - we're caught up?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/04/2023 5:41 PM
Basically yes, the others arrive at the ballroom just in time to see what I described right at the end of the session
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 5:48 PM
(Okay, so technically my conversation with Chiprick happened after my dance with Lord Q, where he talked about what he saw in the bathroom, so maybe Asara came up after that?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/04/2023 8:20 PM
Yes right after that
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 7:44 PM
(Do we want to start Sunday with the group meeting in the ballroom?)
John Dungeon Master — 05/05/2023 9:31 PM
(presumably)
(I mean, as opposed to what?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 10:28 PM
(Still being split up 😰)
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 12:51 AM
(Ohh I see, yeah the rest of you get to the balcony and can see Nev down below right as part of the ceiling collapses)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 3:56 PM
Fucking a
How big is the area? Smutlana wants to cast something to prevent damage and injury, would reverse gravity be appropriate here?
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 10:10 PM
(It’s not clear to me how reverse grav could be used to prevent damage or injury. It can certainly cause both)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 10:47 PM
I’d ceiling is collapsing on people it might do less damage if that were reversed, like if there were 3 stories of building above
I’m not sure what the environment looks like exactly though
John Dungeon Master — Yesterday at 11:04 PM
As I described in detail last time, its a giant room, almost a football field, with a >120 foot ceiling. Its rectangular. The entryway is in the middle of one of the long sides. The balcony, 50 feet up, is along the opposite side. At either end of the balcony, left and right, are stair cases with both giant and human sized stairs. At the middle of the balcony, on that wall, there is an opening to the bridge over Wyrmwatch ave. to the other half of Yunethra Pacifera’s complex. The group, other than Nev, are currently looking down at the wreckage of a small portion of the ball room ceiling that collapsed and the scattering of the attendees below, some taking cover, some, mainly angels, flying up through the hole to confront the threat outside.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 11:25 PM
(What a start to the session this will be)





Commune-icators
(this is the double super secret chat that all the players have so John can’t see us scheming about battle plans)
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:38 AM
Hold up
It’s one thing if her soul was begone’d
But if it was devoured or destroyed…
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:39 AM
Exactly
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:39 AM
That is another thing entirely
I haven’t considered that
Like
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:40 AM
I had but I’m firmly in denial that we won’t be able to save her
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:42 AM
I think only selune would know 
Or at least that might be our only way of asking
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:43 AM
It could certainly help to ask
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:43 AM
Can Nev go on a spirit journey to find out? Go into ethereal plane with true sight active and I dunno
Look Inside folks’ pockets?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:44 AM
Most people are running for it, and it looks like there’s gonna be a fight
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:44 AM
We’re being corralled into a central location
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:45 AM
Yes, but last session ended with the estate being attacked and people running out of the central location.
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:45 AM
Do we try to avoid it?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:45 AM
If we avoid it, what do we do instead?
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:45 AM
I would say patrol
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:46 AM
What will best help us solve the case/get allies for the future?
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:46 AM
Weird thing is that the invaders would be civilians
Killing them would be highly problematic
We’d have to subdue them some other way
Smutlana has reverse gravity
There’s also fear-based abilities to get them to run
We have the flute from Nev
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 11:49 AM
Oh boy, I finally get to talk to Selune again? Woo!
So, assuming Lady R is really super ultra dead and there's no way she's coming back...what's that going to mean for her estate and all the work she was doing? I'm still really curious to find that out. I feel like very quickly the person who most benefits from this is going to present themselves.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:57 AM
I mean, it could very easily be us. We’ve enthralled her assistant
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 11:57 AM
:ohwow:
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:57 AM
And we’re friends with her friends, and we’re invested in the work she was doing
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 11:58 AM
I had not thought of that
this could definitely come back on us
I mean, it sure is strange we're always there when this crazy shit goes down right? lol at least to an outsider
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:59 AM
Oh I meant that we could take advantage, not that we’d look guilty
We all have alibis with the people we’d most need to believe us
And technically nobody but Kaz knows that Linessia is a thrall right now
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 12:01 PM
true
man, so many thoughts
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 12:05 PM
we should update our list of things to do. It’s grown significantly lol
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 12:28 PM
We can check off “find leads on unholy child” at least 🙃
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 2:47 PM
Dude if we inherited her estate wtf
Her husband is obvi first in line
If not her estate then her legacy of Blood War shit
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 2:48 PM
Yeah, not trying to inherit, just maintain access to her resources
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 2:48 PM
curious what it means for the people employed under her and stuff too
I do not want all that either lol
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 2:49 PM
Well hold on - we don’t know if her soul was destroyed
We have to verify before we jump to conclusions
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 2:50 PM
we don't know that, it's just an option.
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 2:50 PM
I was not prepared for the snatch, I’m def unprepared for the no-soul-at-all
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 05/04/2023 2:59 PM
Tbd if her husband recovers from his recent hunting accident injury 🤕
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/04/2023 3:28 PM
yeah I have suspicions about that
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 3:34 PM
Nah, I believe that. She said it’s happened before, and given how he was when we first met her and she got attacked, there’s no way he’s enough of a threat that anyone would have to get him out of the way
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 3:39 PM
Unless spite?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 3:40 PM
Maybe, but we haven’t seen evidence of it
Let’s go back to the killer. If it really was a celestial, as the situation implies, wtf are we gonna do about it?
We’d be lunatics to accuse without hard evidence, and even if we had it, the accusation would be a stretch for people
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 3:43 PM
“Prosecution calls Potted Plant #1 to the stand.”

(time passes in real life)

Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:44 PM
Had one of those late-night brainwaves which could be brilliant and could be bullshit
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:44 PM
!
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:44 PM
So, we know that whatever’s corrupted the celestials, it’s not magic. At least, it’s not a traditional spell that can be detected by a spellcaster 
And we know the celestials haven’t fallen
BUT
What if they’re possessed?
Remember that demon mushroom that Lana ate and didn’t even realize was possessing her? What if that’s what’s wrong with the celestials?
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:47 PM
The fuck
Juiblex or Zuggtmoy?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:48 PM
Now, an obvious flaw here is that we’ve seen weird-acting celestials in the upper planes, where fiends can’t easily go. AND I can’t imagine that a fiend possessing a creature of pure goodness would be easy
But I’m percolating that idea in the back of my mind
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:49 PM
The one that served Juiblex (I think)
Early on, when we were in the Underdark and we tried to go into the shrine, and Smutlana threw up the demon slime
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:50 PM
Yeah that was Juiblex
It looked like a shroom but was a slime
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:50 PM
Yeah
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:51 PM
Well that happened very early on in the campaign, it was some Juiblex versus Zuggtmoy shit
And I don’t think John would just focus the plot on that early on and then forget about it entirely
So it’s bound to come back up
Maybe now is the time
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:52 PM
That’s what I’m thinking. Maybe we’ve had the clues all along and we haven’t realized it
And it would be fairly easy to test, too. We set up a magical space that fiends can’t enter, get a corrupted celestial, and try to bring them into the space
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:54 PM
Ppl are being corralled
But I think the celestials have all left
Damn
Well one thing we could try is for Smutlana to ask the symbiont if there are any fungal traces on the premises
It’s possible that there are spores around and are to blame, maybe the symbiont can find them
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:56 PM
We don’t have to do it now. In fact, it might be smarter to hold off so we can deal with this, then focus on making a good plan for the celestial issue
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:56 PM
Or maybe the spores have caused permanent persisting Changes in the minds and souls of the infected celestials, even though no trace of spores and/or magic remain
Like their brains were simply rewired 
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:57 PM
If they ARENT possessed, we need an alibi for why we just asked them to enter a random circle
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:57 PM
They would certainly be enraged to find out we suspected them of being infected by fiends and not know it, that is certain
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:58 PM
And here’s the thing: there aren’t many ways to detect possession. Identify won’t do it, Greater Resto won’t cure it 
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/04/2023 11:58 PM
Psychedelic drugs do this
I feel like if it were an active infection, it would be traceable/detectable
So it would have to be more sophisticated and nuanced than simple possession
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/04/2023 11:59 PM
Maybe for Smutlana they’d be detectable, but maybe not 
These are demon fungi, after all
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 12:00 AM
The symbiont factors into this somehow.
There was an exposition from the Juiblex demon that unfortunately odo and Smutlana cut tragically short
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:00 AM
Oh yeah, all of this is linked somehow, I’m sure
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:01 AM
I’ll look at my notes on it tomorrow
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 12:01 AM
something about an experimental something or other
We’ve talked about this recently since then
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:01 AM
Exactly
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 12:01 AM
Something about… avoiding detection or something?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:01 AM
Because Smutlana was the test case for it
I think I’m onto something here. I think we’re on the right path
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 12:02 AM
Well, Turdbeak 😤🫣
Good inspiration
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:02 AM
Ty
I’m going to bed though. Gotta be awake for tomorrow
Night!
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 12:03 AM
Cheers
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:11 AM
One last thing I also realized: Nev can cast Sending to her dad
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 12:12 AM
What
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:12 AM
Can’t you?
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 12:12 AM
I have not tried lol
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:12 AM
You know him well, and you can cast the spell
I KNOW
I didn’t realize until now, but you never have
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 12:12 AM
I just always speak to him in my head and now I can't
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 12:13 AM
maybe because a demon fungus is in the way
But afaik there’s no reason Sending shouldn’t work
So… if we found out that demon mushrooms are behind this, we could ask him to meet us and yeet it out of his body
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 12:16 AM
I would laugh if all this time it was as simple as sending to him
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 12:18 AM
We could take him to the myconid shrine
That is known to yeet…
Or could we bring a bit of the shrine with us as a portable yeet-o-matic??
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 12:22 AM
Now that's interesting
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:51 AM
I sure hope the assassin isn't  Branaris. :cursed:
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 8:53 AM
I assumed the demon couldn’t enter the shrine because the myconids cast Forbiddance on it or something to keep fiends out
So we could theoretically take an “infected” celestial to any fiend-proof area and see what happens
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 1:25 PM
What I worry is that there is no trace of the demonic possession. The effect is permanent but the presence is gone, and therefore undetectable. But that would be highly, highly sophisticated
Maybe we can take some of the water from the shrine and create a portable yeet-fountain
Like imagine we have the celestials nearby and we have the yeet crystal in bag of holding
Then we bust it out and if demon then vom
Like maybe it could be a side quest to engineer such a thing with the dankseep colony UwU
Remember, they had the anti-demon spike…
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 05/05/2023 1:28 PM
Fungal infected assassin Branaris :cursed:
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 1:28 PM
If demonic possession; then it removed the possession!
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:29 PM
where do we need to go to do all this?
I wonder if we still have access to the spelljammer ships....
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 1:30 PM
Well, we gotta go down to New Dankseep
Which we can tree travel or planeshift there
But the thing is the stabbiness of that method…
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:31 PM
it just seems like a lot of work for a guess
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 1:31 PM
It’s like Cinderella’s slipper, except highly more stabby
We can’t go around stabbing celestials, it’s off-putting.
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:32 PM
i suppose
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 1:32 PM
Maybe Smutlana could turn it into a spore delivered mechanism
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:32 PM
lol
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 1:40 PM
That’s the thing - I don’t think that we need the fungal shrine, specifically. I think the demon couldn’t enter because the area was magically blessed to keep out fiends, which we could replicate anywhere
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 1:42 PM
Lana’s fungal influence (aka, the demon mushroom yelling “kill your friends!”) stopped when we yeeted it, so I’m less concerned about the effects being permanent 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:44 PM
I've got a few anti-whatever spells now but not sure if any would assist in this trap we wanna make lol
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 1:50 PM
You could use Magic Circle
Set it to keep in fiends and lead a celestial inside
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:51 PM
interesting...
the idea is to find out if the celestials are celestials, right? or if they're possessed
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 1:52 PM
If they're possessed
You could then pull the celestial back out of the circle, forcing the fiend to stay behind
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:53 PM
who do you think would be our likely candidate for this?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 1:53 PM
Chiprick
small, friendly toward us
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:54 PM
oooo....and if he fights it then....that's also a clue
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 1:54 PM
already shows signs of corruption (encouraged us to steal)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 1:54 PM
i mean he is chaotic though too lol
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 1:54 PM
now he MIGHT argue that we'd set up the circle to trap celestials, but WE'D know the truth
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 1:55 PM
true, but even the watchful voyagers were like "that's some real sus behavior"
btw here's all my notes on the myconid shrine incident
Session_3_29_Jan_22.pdf
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:00 PM
he shouldn't feel like we'd want to trap him, we'll have to figure out how to get him to fully trust us in this.
oh thanks for the notes
wow, so you're typing this much every session huh?
lets turn it into a book!
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:01 PM
Oh I type more now, and it’s less organized 😅
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:01 PM
if I were to ask you about a few things I'd like to re-read on....would you be willing to send them to me? lol
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:01 PM
I can send y’all my notes for all the sessions
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:02 PM
!!
four hour download incoming 
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:02 PM
Can’t promise it’ll have what you’re looking for (and at this point I use a separate program to search across the documents whenever I need to look something up)
Nah, they’re all text files
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:02 PM
what program do you use?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:02 PM
It’s called Recoll
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:02 PM
I haven't really done any word docs on my mac here like...how do
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:03 PM
Pages I think
Last time I had a Mac, I got the office suite through school, so I’ve never really used it. But you should be able to save docs as pdf, odt (generic document that May word processor can use), or word format
I’ll send you pdfs though
Later, gotta eat lunch
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:09 PM
ah there it is
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 05/05/2023 2:12 PM
"I return to Shadakla to battle the demon queen" - wuttttt :mindblown: 

That makes way more sense than my notes:
>slime, tells us:
- zuggatboy was possessed, because the thing...what's its name, it was there to
spy on him
Rikshawsaw-ah - the slime is the enemy of zuggatboy's former master
The faceless lord - Juey-blacks is the faceless lord 
Jui-blex -
I reutrn shen-ak-lah *shedakhlah*
as he died
Detritis - that Soverign Pena-lay-iz, like garbage that can't be eaten, gets tossed down the shaft 


I didn't know "shendakla" was a demon queen.
Weeeeiiirrrdddd... did we ever get more info on Shendakla?
Mushroom fungal demon queen or something of the sorts?
I feel like we mighta...but I just forgetssss
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:13 PM
No, I think Shendakla is a place in the Abyss. The demon queen is Zuggtmoi
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 05/05/2023 2:13 PM
ohhhh yeah  you right ,I read that wrong heheh
"Shendakla" is a place, not the demon queen
gotchya
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:14 PM
eww you guys got exploded on by a bloated fungus corpse
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:14 PM
Oh that’s right, you weren’t there for that yet!
Idk HOW that didn’t register with me
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:15 PM
yeah this is all new haha i was a little lost when you two were talking up there
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:15 PM
I literally read the notes, didn’t see Nev or Brigida ONCE, and thought “yeah, everyone will know what I’m talking about”
But that’s the whole incident
I think we got a bit more information later, but I’ll have to search
Possibly from Psilofyr
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:22 PM
good to know Odo has been cheesy AF since the beginning "Odo looks Rusilia dead in the eyes, says “I don’t got mushroom for error, I reckon”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 05/05/2023 2:22 PM
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:22 PM
😂
One of the saddest parts of my later notes is that sometimes things go too fast and I can’t copy down the pun in time
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:27 PM
jesus "Odo distracts the Myconids with an armpit fart performance."
hopefully you just have a brief for "looks like it's time for a cold one"
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:29 PM
That’s in my notes somewhere
Multiple times
It’s too iconic to forget
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:29 PM
when did the mirror thing with Kaz happen? was that backstory or was that in-game?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 2:30 PM
When she got her powers & pact? That was backstory
It was revealed to the party in-game, but Nev was there for that (and all the players knew anyway)
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 2:31 PM
Okay
Juiblex, have you guys heard of that person again?
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 3:14 PM
It’s come up intermittently as we talk about the paste
There was some type of prototype or experiment, evidently, involving Smutlana
But we don’t know who was conducting it
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 05/05/2023 3:15 PM
Maybe Ranjat's house was the missing key to finding out anything about the experiments?
we never went tho
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 3:15 PM
Evidently, it involved being infected by a demon but escaping detection?? I forget
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 05/05/2023 3:15 PM
cuz we'd tpk
OOooO
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 3:17 PM
We haven't heard more about Juiblex specifically as far as I recall, but we've definitely heard more about the demon mushroom thing
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 3:17 PM
We never got the full disclosure
John has reprimanded us since then that he was trying to explain but we killed the demon
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 3:20 PM
I have no memory of it, but I trust yours

My notes (not including from the most recent session)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 05/05/2023 3:32 PM
ooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh we killed the demon?
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 3:38 PM
wait what? lol
was a crucial NPC killed? haha
Thank you for the notes!! :BlobCatHeart:
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 3:39 PM
Session 42 is when we learned more about the demon slime mushroom
Luna (the other former Kenku slave) said that Ranjat was testing some anti-demonic-possession dust on Lana. It didn't fully work, but it did let her keep her memories and free will while possessed 
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 3:41 PM
definitely on to something there
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 3:43 PM
We also know that Ranjat got the dust from a merchant who looked “like a man, but taller and with blue skin," and Kaz was reminded of some of the people she saw in the auction at Arcadia.
Potentially a planetar?
Or an elemental or something
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 3:43 PM
blue skin hmm
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 3:44 PM
either way, why would a fiend want anti-fiend dust? VERY suspicious
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 3:44 PM
very sus
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 3:56 PM
Man, I forgot how freaked-out Kaz was by everything in the beginning
She really did find her ground once she figured out some of the details surrounding her pact
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 3:59 PM
I am really enjoying reading all this, my memory is the worst. So thank you. It is cool to read the stuff that happened before I came along too.
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 3:59 PM
😁
I also love to go back and read through our past adventures. It's why I keep such lengthy notes
It's also why I initially formatted my notes as a story
That got exhausting through
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 05/05/2023 4:00 PM
haha
I appreciate the way it's written, even the more recent ones. isn't so very specific and just kinda gets to the main points.
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 5:11 PM
Devil-ish fiend wanted anti-demon powder?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 5:14 PM
Perhaps. I can’t remember if it was specifically anti-demon
Did it say in my notes?
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 5:43 PM
Yeah, I wrote “anti-demon”
That’s a good point. Maybe he wanted it as a safeguard, since iirc he was a power-broker between demons and devils?
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 05/05/2023 7:11 PM
Traditionally I think it was just devils
But it seems that it most recently started involving demons
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 05/05/2023 7:29 PM
Yeah
