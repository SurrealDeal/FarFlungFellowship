    • It’s late afternoon on the 6th of Myrtul
    • Odo finds Emy Applehill’s husband, Gaorg, and repays the loan he took out to buy his armor.
    • Sir Gondrian gives Odo a letter from Odo’s father’s longtime courier, Marshal. The letter is from Waterdeep, and bears Odo’s faher’s seal.
    • Odo’s dad, Otho Falcanspur, has gotten a letter from Sir Gondrian, who says that Odo has learned all that he can teach him. His dad says he’s proud of Odo and that it’s time for him to strike out on his own and accomplish his own heroic deeds as part of his ancestral duty.
    • His dad also says that the family’s funds are tied up in Orenson’s mission, and Orenson is now pretty far in debt ($15k dragons (gold?)). Odo has the right to seize any and all magical items for his family, and to keep any magical weapons he finds for himself.
    • Odo feels conflicted about taking valuable artifacts from Orenson, since Orenson has had so much bad luck lately. Zuggtboy tries to reassure him that it’s okay to take the magical stuff, since his father has funded the expedition
    • Odo also realizes that the party’s lizards have left tracks leading back to town. We immediately set out to cover our tracks
    • it takes us all night and the better part of the next day to cover our tracks, leave a false trail, and return to camp with our lizards climbing along the walls to avoid leaving a fresh trail. We’re exhausted, so we all crash at Odo’s place.
    • around 2am, we’re woken by a blast and the ringing of the alarm bell. Kaz, Lyesgiel, and Zuggtboy don their armor, and Lyesgiel and Zuggtboy run out to see what’s going on while Kaz helps Odo finish putting on his heavier armor.
    • the half moon has just risen in the east, looking like a grinning mouth. it illuminates the nearby roofs and the people coming out to investigate the screams coming from the town center. They see the roof of Lady Rhydell’s house has been blown off, icicles surround the scene, there’s an orc corpse on the ground and another in the house, and Lady Rhydell herself stands out in front, drenched in blood. “Assassins!” she cries out to anyone to asks what happened.
    • A voice from the north watchtower cries out “Orcs approaching! From the East!” A moment later, the south watchtower cries out “Orcs! To the south!”
    • Orenson and Sir Gondrian both come out as well to see what’s going on. They apparently haven’t been attacked.
    • Noncombatants are ordered to shelter in the temple. Flaming arrows begin streaking down into the town. Odo and Kaz run for the South watchtower, while Zuggtboy and Lyesgiel run for the North. They see orc war parties marching on the town. It’s difficult to count them, but each group of orcs seems to have at least 50 torchlights.
    • The party quickly asks the townsfolk what defensive supplies they have. Their supplies are limited – no flammables, no ballistae, no nothing. (Dynamite doesn’t exist - the mining gets done with picks and hammers)
    • Over in the North watchtower, Sir Gondrian is giving a speech to his troops, the Galavanters. “You are warriors of Waterdeep! You will defend the walls against these orcs and we will throw them back!” as he speaks, a huge catapaulted ball of flaming pitch overshoots the town and explodes a pine tree. Lady Rhydell says “I’d better take care of that!” and literally flies off 
    • As we’re planning, we look up and see another group coming from the west. Kaz suggests hiding the noncombatants in the more defensible mines, and Odo has one of the less effective fighters pass along the message
    • The party reunites, firing down on the orcs as they test the town’s defenses. We meet up behind Gilbert Orenson’s house, and see people ringing the alarm bell from his house’s tower
    • suddenly, an orc climbs over the palisade wall

      
      

      










    • she’s dressed and painted as a Claw of Luthic (one of the orcish deities), so she’s probably a shaman. Likely a member of the Stonetooth orcish tribe native to the region
    • another climbs over chanting “Bognar! Bognar!” Odo knows that Bognar the new leader of the orc tribes



















    • to our right is the palisade, to our left is a sheer drop down a cliff. One orc knocks one of the other guards down the cliff to his death, cleaves another’s face with his battleaxe
    • we battle the orcs, slaughter their leader and their shaman. as we fight, we hear the screams to the west, and the sounds of orcs breaking into the town in the distance.
    • to the north where the ditch ends, there’s a mound where the wall meets the cliff. We see a 20ft tall hill giant, looking murderous, step over the wall. From the main gate, we hear others cry out “troll!”



















    • We pass Sir Gondrian, and agree to take on the giant if he takes the troll. The giant smashes the bathhouse as he stomps through the town, and Zuggtboy cries out in horror “No! The last fun place in town!”
    • there are little dots of light that move in front of the moon called the Tears of Selune. we’d just call the moon “Selune”. Kaz thinks offhand that she might know something about the Tears of Selune, but can’t think of anything mid-battle.
    • Kaz makes giants flee in terror. She casts Dissonant Whispers on the giant, terrifying him and causing him to turn and retreat toward the wall.
    • Zuggtboy cries out “Stop, in the name of Psilofyr and bath houses!” at the giant. It does nothing
    • Odo says “Reckon today wasn’t TOE-tally bad” as he smashes the giant’s toe. The giant falls backward onto the fence stakes, killing him.
    • We rush over to help with the troll. As we arrive, a bloody Sir Gondrian skewers the troll, which falls to the ground but heals and gets back up. Sir Gondrian calls for fire, and Kaz creates a bonfire beneath it while Zuggtboy casts Chill Touch to prevent it from healing. It crumbles to dust as a few of the guards close the gate once more.
    • We hear shouts, look up toward the cliff. An orc riding an enormous boar leaps over the fence and gallops down the main street, flanked by two dire wolves. We hear more chants of “Bognar! Bognar!” as the rider barrels toward us. The orc rider has metal armor with the Stonetooth orc crest (orcs slaughtering humans) on the front, and giant metal spikes with heads impaled on them sticking out from the back. Bognar knocks Sir Gondrian unconscious with one blow of his longsword, then attacks Odo.
    • We fight on, dodging attacks from Bognar and his animals. He moves to break through the front gate, yelling out an orcish warcry as he goes. The rest of the orcs have ceased attacking, merely chanting to their leader as they wait for him to open the gates.
    • Far to the south, we see a brief mushroom cloud of flame. Presumably it’s Lady Rhydell. Zuggtboy and Odo take on the wolves while Kaz and Lyesgiel take shots at Bognar
    • Bognar had nearly broken through the gates when Sir Gondrian regained consciousness. Seeing that the situation was dire, Sir Gondrian drew on his experience as a battlemaster and as a paladin of Torm, deity of self-sacrifice and battle. He yelled out a challenge to Bognar. “Coward!” Kaz piles on to give him advantage, crying “coward! coward!” Bognar turns around, death in his eyes, and yells out in rage as he starts to run toward Sir Gondrian. It’s not even a contest. He knocks Sir Gondrian to the ground, slashes furiously at his unconscious body, then turns to charge back to the gate. Kaz and Lyesgiel fire almost simultaneously, the force of Kaz’s eldritch blast pushing Lyesgiel’s arrow forward into Bognar’s roaring mouth and out the back of his throat. Zuggtboy whips a thorny vine around Bognar’s throat, pulling him off his boar and strangling the last little bit of life from his body.
    • Lyesgiel heals Sir Gondrian from the brink of death. Sir Gondrian, realizing after a moment that Bognar is dead and knowing that orcs respect displays of strength, says “we should show them the body.” He and the party drag Bognar’s corpse up to the parapet, then dangle it over the side. The orc cheering dies down, replaced by muttering. Zuggtboy mocks the gathered orcs by perfectly mimicking their cries of “Bognar! Bognar!”
    • in a secret pouch beneath Bognar’s armor, Kaz finds 5 pp, 61 gp, and a gold medallion larger than a coin with a symbol of a winged snake on one side and the stonetooth tribe symbol on the other side. Winged snake logo is the symbol of the black network, the zhentarim, the mercenaries that the town DIDN’T hire who got pissy about it.
    • Odo sees that Bognar’s sword is a masterwork of Dwarven make, with a compartment in the hilt. It looks like the sword is designed to dispense a vial of poison. He takes the sword.
    • Sir Gondrian makes a snide comment that he didn’t see Orenson fighting on the walls (which he wasn’t)
    • We agree to rest for the remainder of the night, help care for the wounded and bury the dead, and explore the portal the next day
    • The next morning dawns. The town’s mood is grim and despondent. Orenson tries to rally everyone from a milk crate in the center of town, but its clear that nobody is interested and he can’t read the room.
    • We decide to talk to Sir Gondrian about the medallion. He’s furious, having expected the Zhentarim to cut off trade or do something else shady, but not orchestrate a full-on attack. Kaz gives him the medallion to use to his own ends.
    • As a longtime retainer of the Falcanspur family, Sir Gondrian also received a letter from Otho Falcanspur and is willing to back Odo if he decides to take the artifacts for himself and his family. Odo folds up his own letter into an origami pig and gives it to a three-year-old child.
    • Sir Gondrian shares that mining foreman Damien Blackmore might know more about artifacts, along with the missing archaeology 2nd in command Xanthos, who examined all of the artifacts (along with apprentice Cassie Logarette, who works under him)
    • Sir Gondrian thinks that some valuables shipped back to Waterdeep, possibly bound for the market there. Magic item market is like our fine art market.
    • Odo doesn’t get the sense that there’s artifact theft by deception. Rather, they just haven’t found things quickly enough to make up their operating costs. They were also hoping to find more livingspace beyond the faultline, not Underdark caves. Still, it’s possible that there’s another way to reach whatever was sliced off, which may be what Xanthos was looking for.
    • Odo inspires Kaz, saying how incredible she is for having the power to look into minds and cast deadly blasts of force and make giants flee. He says that her power is what saves children like Emy Applehill’s son, Toby. He says he can’t wait to see how her power grows over time, patting her on the shoulder.
    • Kaz gets a little teary-eyed. Softly, she tells Odo, Zuggtboy, and Lyesgiel that she’d left her previous post as a researcher without telling any of her friends and family what had happened, and that she’d been lonely ever since. But, she said, she was glad she’d met them, and that they’d all become friends.
