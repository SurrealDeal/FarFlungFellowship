    • Tammy is T and Leo is L. P circles are Selunite paladins. Black S circles are humanoid forms made of shadow. D are demonic creatures with wings and horns, but their bottom torso fades into nothingness (they’re also made of demonic shadowyness). GSD is a greater shadow demon. Red S are unnaturally pale humanoids wearing black. The oval is the portal projected by the mirror, which is bigger than the mirror itself.
        ◦ we gather that the new paladins aren’t particularly strong
    • Nev flies out over the crowd of shadow creatures and channels Selune’s divine power to destroy the undead creatures around herself. One of the humanoids is carrying an artifact that gives the creatures advantage on their save, but it’s still not enough to save them. She completely clears out all the small shadowy humanoid forms around the other paladins. Smutlana sends out a prayer of apology to Selune, transforms herself into a draconic form, and blasts the crypt around Shar’s Shadow Strikers (the cluster of enemies by the portal) with her breath weapon. Odo’s sword turns into cool, soothing, silvery-blue moonlight as he hacks and slashes at the Strikers. Kaz sees how the shadow demons suffer when the light hits them (as she’d suspected they would), so she casts Sickening Radiance on them, the portal, and part of the gaping hole in the crypt floor.
    • More shadow demons fly out of the hole, avoiding the Sickening Radiance. One whips chains around Nev’s legs, pulling her to the ground and grappling her as its necrotic barbs cut into her. Another two teleport next to Kaz and do the same to her. A greater shadow demon blasts Lana and the paladins with shadowy necrotic energy, but they manage to stay standing. A wave of undead shadows try to climb the ladder into the crypt and are immediately vaporized by the Sickening Radiance.
    • Odo lunges into action, throwing a dagger from his bracer at one of the shadow demons grappling Kaz and cleaving another that’s grappling Nev, helping her to stand up. Kaz teleports away from the two grappling her, back-to-back with Tammy.
    • The hardened Shar cultists see Nev, a powerful Selunite cleric, and focus most of their attacks on her. They manage to grapple and restrain her. She casts Bane on them in response, and Lana heals her and attacks the cultists with Wither and Bloom.
    • Tammy is looking rough. Kaz passes her a greater healing potion with a “Here. You’ll need it.” She nods, taking it and tucking it into her pocket.
    • Nev looks through the portal and sees the Argentil Palace within the Gates of the Moon, the mystical realm of her goddess. Right on the other side of the portal, the beauty is marred by the miasma of dark shadow leaking in and writhing with swirling mist. She gathers that there’s something going on there that’s bad. Angry, she turns and crits on a Guiding Bolt against the greater shadow demon, killing it in one shot with 112 points of radiant damage.
    • One of the cultists looks at the remaining rear guard and says something in Abyssal. He then turns to Nevaeh, spits “Pathetic. Your goddess dies tonight!” and teleports through the portal.
    • We finish off the rest of the rear guard. The remaining paladins run over to the hole in the floor. The lead paladin, Regald Wexby, turns to Nev and does a double take once he recognizes her. “You! You were- how are you-?” he babbles, shocked that she’s managed to escape her cell. 
      “I, I.. what?” she responds.
Regald stammers out “You, you’re a heretic, we were told. You’re supposed to be in prison!”
      Leo and Tammy immediately leap to Nev’s defense. “But she killed so many of them!” “You have to be kidding me!”
      Regald looks confused, but as he looks up at the portal he gets distracted. “Why is… why was this here?” 
      Another paladin chimes in and says “They must have known about the mass mystery of the night and chose this time to attack”
      “But, but it was Priestess Jesselia’s orders to move the Sojourner’s Mirror down here!” Regald replies.
      “And who was it who accused Nev of being a heretic, exactly?” Kaz asks, pointedly.
      Regald looks pensive. “Something… something isn’t right. Where is that?” He looks into the portal and starts to recognize the location, and sees Shar cultists and large demons moving toward the Palace of Selune. “No… no!”
    • We prepare to enter the Gates of the Moon and fight off the Shar cultists. Tammy helps Nev put on her heavier armor while Kaz draws some extra power through the Rod of Drosys to get her spell slots back. Lana meditates briefly, connecting with her spores so that she can wildshape again.
    • Regald sighs. “I don’t know what to believe, but we’re under attack and you fought with us, so I’m choosing to trust you. What do we do about this?” They all look to Nev, as the only clergy member not at the mass ritual.
      “You can’t trust anybody but yourselves right now.” Nev replies. “I know that’s hard to understand and believe, but trust in Selune and in your guts. Jesselia is behind this, maybe controlled or maybe misled.” Nev tells the paladins that they need to protect the portal and the House of the Moon, get everyone they can, and stay together while the Far Flung Fellowship goes to Selune’s realm to help her. Tammy wants to come too. Nev manages to convince her to stay behind, to take care of the others and to tell our story.
    • We say goodbye and good luck to the paladins, taking a moment to thank Tammy in particular for saving Nev and to wish her good luck. The paladins give us their blessing as we go through the portal. Nev picks up the rear, cloak billowing behind her as she steps into her goddess’ realm.
