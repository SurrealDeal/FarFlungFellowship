Midsummer Flashback
    • Nev and Lana are the only ones interested in paying for a tailored rush job. After a brief discussion of what Nev wants, the tailor has her assistants assemble bolts of fabric on a table, pulls out a wand, and spends ten minutes assembling the dress with magic. She’s delighted.
    • Lana gets a gender-neutral pantsuit.
    • Kaz gets a light grey dress with silver embroidery off the rack (she’s not a noble nor a Selunian priestess, so she doesn’t want to pay for really pricey dresses)
    • Odo rents a nice outfit in neutral colors
    • Lady Renalia arrives to the celebration on a palanquin, along with a few other drow worshippers of Eilistraee (who are co-hosting the event)
    • we all get hype dancing. 
    • Nevaeh pours some milk over an altar and says prayers to Selune as a libation. The milk turns into a shimmering opalescent field that spreads along the altar (moonfire -  indicates that Selune is pleased with an offering, though it’s very rare to see)
        ◦ Nev receives a blessing: can cast Find the Path 3x in the next month. She hears “Use it wisely” in her mind
    • Priestess Asara and Lady Efrione’s head bodyguard, who have been making eyes at each other for months, disappear with each other by the end of the night
        ◦ in Silverymoon, midsummer is also the Festival of Love, and similar to our concept of Valentine’s Day (though Kaz was probably among those who wasn’t really celebrating romance ;) )

City of Brass
    • It’s Eliasus 3
    • the efreet shoots FUCKING LIGHTNING from his bionic hands. Luca says his name is “Metal Hands Mu’az”
    • Nev casts Twilight Sanctuary and gets tunneled for making the room darker
    • Kaz blows off Horzeen al Rathi’s head with an eldritch blast. His salamander buddy cries out in despair, then tunnels Kaz in revenge. She Wonder-Woman-blocks the spear, but gets caught off-guard by the tail whip that follows.
    • Odo goes one-on-one with Metal Hands Mu’az for several rounds
    • Kaz regains a spell slot using the last charge on the Rod of Drosys, the curls of her hair looking like fractals as she does so.
    • Kaz casts Synaptic Static on Mu’az, muddling his thoughts. Lana casts Blindness on him (and on the final salamander). Mu’az runs for it, and Kaz blows up the final salamander. Lana chases him through the building and into a secret room behind a bookshelf.
        ◦ Mu’az nearly knocks Lana unconscious, but eldritch energy from Kaz’s Gift of the Protectors crawls through her and keeps her standing
    • Luca runs in and tells us the Illuminated are coming, and that Metal Hands Mu’az is a criminal (which is why Horzeen wouldn’t sell the slaves – they knew he was a crook).
    • Two Illuminated come in and of course blame us Ins for the chaos. Kaz manages to get them to listen to her that Metal Hands Mu’az is in the building (she also tries to bribe them to leave the party alone, but they aren’t willing to take bribes for such a serious crime). 
        ◦ The Illuminated doubt her at first, since any criminal would lie that a bigger criminal caused their chaos, but Kaz manages to describe him and his lightning well enough to convince them
        ◦ the INSTANT the two Illuminated are out of sight, Kaz uses her Limbo globe to fashion the key to the slaves’ cuffs, freeing them.
    • The Illuminated fly down to the secret room and beat Mu’az unconscious, then start cheering in Ignin.
    • The Illuminated interrogate us as to what happened. Kaz gives them a sanitized version and they buy it. They agree to give us Luca and her fellow slaves if we never mention what happened (“I captured Metal Hands Mu’az. Alone.” says the head Illuminated)
        ◦ If we ever do mention it and he finds out, then the theft of four slaves will be pinned on us
    • The slaves look blindsided, grateful, and utterly relieved to be out of the terrible conditions they’d lived in for years. They introduce themselves as Ulf (the tiefling lute player), Anterio (the human male drummer), and Yarae (the tabaxi piper).
        ◦ Luca is the guitarist
    • We’re stopped by a patrol of Illuminated as we cross the city. Lana claims that we bought the slaves to start a band and we just manage to convince them of the lie.
    • We manage to make it through the portal back to Sigil without incident. The former slaves collapse to their knees and start crying, overwhelmed. The rest of the party sits down with them in the middle of the street.
    • We learn that they were originally from Sigil. Yarae asks why we rescued them, and Kaz confesses that she had a few questions for them, but ultimately she saved them because she didn’t want them to suffer as slaves. The rest of the Far Flung Fellowship agree.
    • Everyone heads back to the house on Lark street. We crash for the night. The next morning, Lana uses her rust spores to dissolve the slave cuffs fused to their wrists.
    • Over breakfast Kaz asks Luca about the mirror. Luca says she bought it from a fence in the Hive ward, and that both of them had thought it was a normal mirror. She thinks his name was Kang something, and offers to guide us the the Ruin Warrens where he was staying. 
        ◦ Luca grew up in the Hive
    • We follow Luca through the city and into the Hive while the rest of her troupe go in search of work at local taverns. Lean-tos and shantys are built against every building and on top of every ruin. The streets are packed, most people living in poverty. There are also plenty of “barmy” people wander around, mumbling to themselves. Even with Lana casting Pass Without Trace, we “golden lords” are still noticed a few times
    • The Ruin Warrens were at one point some sort of amphitheater. Most of the coliseum stone has been carted off, but what little still stands had been turned into a shanty neighborhood spanned by bridges. Between old stone columns are little market stalls, with ragged salespeople hawking their wares on threadbare blankets. Finally, we reach a stone wall. Luca can’t quite remember where Kang is in the warren, but she and Kaz ask around and eventually get someone who’s willing to bring Kaz (and only Kaz) to Kang.
        ◦ Luca asks for a “bladeling” named Kang Din
        ◦ Odo vibe-checks the person offering to take Kaz to Kang, and does well enough to realize he’s not trying to harm her or lead her astray
        ◦ Lana turns herself into a fly and follows Kaz
    • Odo goes over to a dwarf muttering to himself and rummaging through a bag, and offers him some jerky. The dwarf turns to Odo, wary. “Are you… from the Abyss?” He pauses, then shouts “They’re coming to steal us!”
    • his shouting draws a crowd, who come over to see what’s up. They get suspicious of Odo and Nev’s fine armor
        ◦ Random townsperson: “What have you got on then?” 
        ◦ Nev: “Rude. Clothes!”
    • Kaz travels downstairs to a metal grate, which she has to climb into and crawl through a tunnel. The claustrophobia kicks in, but she makes it through. At the end of the passageway, a cloaked figure sits on a crate.
    • Kang is wary that Kaz knows who he is, and that he had the mirror. In his line of work, it’s not done to share where things come from. He eyes her suspiciously, even as she pleads that she doesn’t know anything else about him and that she’s willing to buy the information.
        ◦ Kaz definitely overpays for the information, but she doesn’t care.
    • Kang stole the mirror from a hag in Oinos, the first layer of the Gray Wastes of Hades. Her name was Angina Lockjaw, and she was a larva rancher in Pars Kovarik
        ◦ As Kang speaks, his hood falls back, revealing a gaunt face with blades growing out of it (bladelings are native to Akarron). He doesn’t seem to notice or care, too consumed with Kaz’s 200 gp.
    • Kaz climbs out to find a crowd surrounding Odo and Nevaeh, demanding that they pay the toll or suffer the consequences. Lana turns herself into a panther to escort Kaz and look intimidating. When the crowd decides to rob the party, Lana leaps into the rafters, Kaz Dimension Doors Luca out, Nevaeh casts Greater Invisibility on Odo, and flies out herself.
        ◦ the crowd throws what weapons they have at Nevaeh, the only one they can see, but most fall to the ground without striking true
    • We manage to sneak away. As we leave the Hive, we see more rabble-rousers, standing on crates and shouting that the people living in the Hive are being kept in misery and tyrrany by the people living in the Lady’s Ward, and the tyrants should be stopped. There are lots of cheers to these statements.
    • We get home and learn the rest of Luca’s troupe had gotten hired at a tavern called the The Yellow Mule in the Market Ward. We also learn the story of how they were sold into slavery: They spent time playing at taverns in Sigil and other outlying planes. One day, a friend asked them to play in their tavern in the City of Brass, where they didn’t really know the local customs. While there, someone accused them of blaspheming against the Grand Sultan (though they swear that they’d just been talking), and the Illuminated swept in and sold them into slavery. They’d thought they’d be under Horzeen’s control forever.
    • Gray Wastes: ‘a really bad place’. Yggdrasil’s root starts in the wastes. It’s one of the outer planes and everything is literally grey. If you stay there too long, it makes you dreary and depressed, to the point you want to give up on life. 
        ◦ Night hags are fae hags who migrated to the lower planes years ago and became fiendish. Many night hags live in the Gray Wastes and farm larvae. Larvae are the lowliest incarnation of evil souls, which are collected, sold, and used by fiendish forces (because souls can be drained and used for power).
        ◦ Shar has a realm in the Gray Wastes, as a goddess of darkness
    • The party decides to go to Waterdeep so that Odo’s father can see him

Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 2:18 PM
Odo turns to Smutlana
"Ayy uh Smutlana, I done be wonderin' if ya'd be willing to lend me a bit of coin - I done be figurin' that maybe the fact I been gone for a mighty long while that I could done take a few gifts to me sisters?"
Odo then turns to Norman
"Ayyy uh Norman, fella, you done know where I could done find some, like, trinkets of the city-of-doors, Sigil trinkets for travelers whom done wanna find something to remember the city by?"
(ooc: Odo wants to buy 6 trinkets that are like touristy trinkets about Sigel )
Odo then looks at Kaz
"Ayy uh Kaz, ya done be willing to talk with my Pops a bit, when we see him, I done feel like ya got much more of a mighty stronger nogging explainin' all the Netherese things we done did see ?? "  Odo asks smiling "- since Pops did done do Netherese kinda research for a mighty long time, maybe ya done show him that fancy Sextant that we did done find too - if anyone done be able to believe some of the wild stuff we did done seen with the Netherese it would done be my pops" 
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 2:21 PM
Kaz smiles. “I’d be honored to talk to your father, Odo. And I’d love to hear more about his experiences with the Netherese… artifacts, I take it?” She looks a bit confused. You’d recall that the Netherese empire fell centuries ago, which is what she assumes you’re talking about 
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 2:24 PM
(oh yeah, like was it the Netherese that had the pointed stars things, the bracers Kaz has?)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 2:24 PM
(Yep!)
(Kaz doesn’t know your dad fought the splinter group)
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Today at 2:24 PM
(oooohhh, yeah I thought Kaz mighta known cuz Oodo may have talked with Nevayuh about it a bit but maybe Kaz don't know hehe)
(after the big auditorium fight and pegausus death Odo talked to Nevaeh about the Netherese briefly - but Kaz might not have overheard)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Today at 3:31 PM
(Yeah, she wouldn’t have been listening in to their conversation)
