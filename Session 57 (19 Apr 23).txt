    • The plan is to spend 3 days in Wildspace, then spend another few days in the Astral plane while the crew tests systems. Then, we’ll head to Krigala (the first layer of the Beastlands) and take the landing boat down to the surface for a short visit.
        ◦ We pick the largest and nicest state rooms, on the Promenade deck. Nev picks the room closest to the spa, Kaz goes in the room next to her, Lana goes across from Kaz, and Odo picks the top room to Lana’s left.
        ◦ We learn that there are 3 spelljammers, each taking 8hr shifts. The newest spelljammer is Henrick Alevendion (22 year old human), and it’s one of his first jobs after graduating from the Academy of the Celestion in Sigil. He excitedly shows Odo around the ship at his request and explains the various mechanisms, exits, and defenses.
        ◦ Nandy Everglade is the guest coordinator
    • The stars seem fixed in place, but we occasionally see a large heavenly body fly by the windows. Kaz and Nev spend the morning of the first day skinny dipping, then spends the afternoon getting spa treatments and the evening playing games. Nev also goes around blessing the ship, and sets up an altar. Odo excitedly tests out the trash jettison and says hi to Mr. Fimrith (spelljammer) and Ms. Mubarrak (spelljammer). Smutlana does some meditation to get used to her new body and tries to talk to her symbiont again, but can’t focus very well.
        ◦ Lana also tells the party about her conversation with her symbiont when she first made contact and got her fungal body. Smutlana asked the symbiont many questions about their past and how they came to connect with Smutlana, but because they’re not humanoid, they communicate differently and it’s hard to get answers. She learns the following:
            ▪ “The spores primarily desire to right an ancient wrong and reunite a family that was sundered” 
            ▪ Smutlana asks if she was chosen, and learns that the answer is “Partially yes.”
            ▪ The symbiont is the offspring of some type of organism in a faraway place.
            ▪ The entity is the source of all of Lana's magic and spore abilities. They don't come from Psilofyr, they come from the symbiont
    • In the middle of the second day, the Captain makes a shipwide announcement that there will be a sight to see from the Observation Deck. Kaz immediately Dimension Doors up to the lounge, leaving the rest of the party to walk up themselves. We look out the window to see Toril, with the Chultan peninsula sticking out like a scorpion’s tail and the Sword Coast lying vertically just above. Behind the planet is Selune, with the stars that make up Selune’s tears just behind.
    • We see some of the other planets in the system as we travel on, including Anadia, the rings of Glyth, Collier, Chautry, and Chandros.
    • Eventually we pass into the Astral Plane, the stars giving way to silvery mist with swirls of colorful clouds and dancing lights. The captain invites the party to the Command Bridge, and they all dutifully troop up the stairway to the command deck. Out the front windows, we see a spectacular rainbow crystal nebula, taking up a huge portion of the view out the window. He explains that it’s called the Crystal Nebula, and it’s one of the most beautiful sights in the Astral Plane, but also one of the most deadly. Warren Foeslayer mentions that he has a history with the place, and states outright that he wants revenge on whatever lives within and “gets you” when you get close. He’s clearly bothered being so close to the cloud, and very intent on settling whatever business he has with the thing within.
    • With a bit of careful questioning, Warren explains that the thing inside the nebula is called the Voidmaw. It claimed his cousin’s ship, so he’s vowed to go inside the nebula one day and destroy it. The Voidmaw is amorphous and hideous, with grasping tendrils and a translucent body. As far as anyone knows, it’s native to the Astral Plane.
    • We pass by the Crystal Nebula and eventually come to an emerald green color pool, which leads to the Beastlands. We fly through into a bright blue sky, with clouds and trees beneath us in all directions. Kaz pulls out the Planar Sextant and starts making measurements (there are no obvious demarcations, but she can see the outline of a giant treelike structure filling a large portion of the sky). It’s a perfectly beautiful day.
        ◦ She knows that the tree is Yggdrasil, an interplanar pathway. The river Oceanus also runs from Elysium through the Beastlands to Arborea (it also reaches the Gates of the Moon in Ysgard)
        ◦ the Beastlands is an infinite plane. There are lots of beasts, but its also the plane where animals (and some humanoids) go when they die. The animal lords have their domains here (including the lady Lord of Cats)
    • We spend the next few hours on an aerial safari through the Beastlands, sailing toward Yggdrasil. Eventually, we can see a faint outline of a branch even without the sextant, the massive offshoots disappearing into other planes in the distance. Cpt Cloudsilver leads our away party sailing on the launchboat to Yggdrasil, with Mr. Fimrith spelljamming the small craft and Mr. Basson as a weapon operator. We land on the mountain-sized branch and climb across the bark. The tree is very tree-like, except its huge and has a planar feel to it. Kaz makes numerous measurements.
    • We meet a giant fuzzy caterpillar the size of a sheep. It seems docile towards us. Nev pets it and discovers that its extremely soft. Later, we see person-sized squirrels approaching us, wearing armor and carrying spears. They stop at a distance and regard us. Kaz waves and says hello in Celestial, but they don’t seem to understand.
    • We get back on the launchboat, sail down to the trees below, and spend the rest of the day hiking through the forest. We’re warned that there can be some dangerous things in the trees, but the crew also trusts us to handle ourselves. We see dozens of different beasts, including wild horses, apes, and an almiraj.
    • Nev befriends a tressym with a bit of food and Lana’s and Kaz’s encouragement (we all want a flying cat pet). The tressym looks like Grumpy Cat, has a human level of intelligence, and can understand but not speak Common. She seems to be having a bad day, and doesn’t seem happy with her life in the Beastlands in general, so she’s willing to come with the party on their adventures. Kaz uses telepathy to learn that, since her name is in Tressymspeak, we won’t be able to pronounce it, but she’d be fine with us giving her a name.
        ◦ From left to right: an almiraj, a tressym
    • We arrive back to the Starglimmer with our new tressym friend. Kaz gives her the tour, and she walks around with her wings folded. At dinner, Cpt Cloudsilver lets us know that we’ll be heading back to the Astral Plane the next day. We asks to see the “thunder lizards” (dinosaurs) on the Forbidden Plateau the next morning before we leave, and he acquiesces to flying over.
    • The Forbidden Plateau is filled with rolling hills and rivers, and dinosaurs roam across it like in Jurassic Park. Smutlana in particular is excited to see the alosaurus and triceratops.
    • We fly back into the Astral Plane. During lunch, we see Warren Foeslayer staring out the window, fist clenched as we pass by the Crystal Nebula. He explains that his cousin, Cpt Graff Foeslayer, took his ship into the nebula looking for the Voidmaw. He found it, but it bested him, and only a few of his crew got away to tell the tale. He had a magical axe of great power, with a silvery haft and crystalline blade, that was also lost.
    • Odo and Lana suggest that we’d be willing to help. Foeslayer looks excited by the prospect, and offers up his cousin’s axe if we manage to kill the Voidmaw. Kaz is reluctant to chase danger on her vacation, but the others seem enthusiastic, so she resigns herself to making the best plan she can to take the beast down. Foeslayer suggests that if we asked the captain to take the launchboat into the nebula to fight the Voidmaw, he’d be more willing to say yes. 
    • We troop up to the bridge with Foeslayer. Cpt Cloudsilver looks us over and sighs. “I see you’ve recruited allies this time” he says to Foeslayer. Nev tries to convince him that killing the Voidmaw is a noble cause, while Smutlana leads with the idea that it’s better to prepare the crew in case the ship is ever attacked. Cpt. Cloudsilver replies that he’s under strict orders to run from danger. With prodding from Lana, Kaz points out that she’d also rather not fight, but if we take the launchboat out ourselves, the Captain wouldn’t technically be disobeying orders and we might be able to make this patch of Wildspace safer.
    • The Captain decides to come with us, but then realizes that either he or Foeslayer would have to remain on the Starglimmer. He makes Foeslayer swear to keep us guests alive, and his gaze briefly flicks to Nevaeh (Nev rolls a nat 20 and notices. The aroace Kaz rolls a nat 1 and does not). Odo recruits Hendrick to pilot the launch through our “grand adventure” and he excitedly agrees.
    • We sail out into the nebula. Crystals bounce off each other and tumble through space, and Kaz uses Magehand to grab a few as souveniers. An enormous asteroid spins by, cracked open like a geode to reveal more crystals. Foeslayer guides us toward it, and lands at the entrance to the Voidmaw’s lair within. It’s rather dim inside. We creep cautiously into the chamber until a jellyfish-shaped creature floats out, hisses at us, and sprays poison gas in our direction. Foeslayer bellows, pulls out his double-barreled musket, and blasts the thing. The Voidmaw flies forward and engulfs him as Odo leaps out of the way.
        ◦ The Voidmaw occasionally releases surges of destructive cosmic energy at the party.
