    • We found out that the bandit who captured Lyesgiel that we took prisoner has escaped
    • We meet Brigida, who’s drinking in the Applehill Alehouse to mourn her friends who died in battle. Odo invites her to stop drowning her sorrows in ale and help us find the prisoner. She’s taciturn, but agrees
    • We inspect the area behind the barn where the prisoner was held, but don’t find him or his tracks.
    • Sir Gondrian comes up, asking if we can talk about what we found out earlier. He’s holding the gold medallion. We agree to join him in the inn’s back room to discuss it. Lady Rhydell joins us, as she’s one of Sir Gondrian’s mercenaries.
        ◦ Sir Gondrian thinks it’s suspicious that assassins targeted Lady Rhydell before the attack, as orcs aren’t typically su subtle or strategic. We consider that there might be a mole, but can’t think of whom
    • We go to speak with Cassie Logarette, apprentice to head archaeologist Xanthos. Gilbert Orenson wont let us talk to her because she’s “very busy”
    • Kaz suggests we jump from the palisade onto the roof to access the upstairs where we think Cassie is. Brigida instead sneaks us around back and uses pitons to climb to the second floor and jimmy a window open
    • we climb into Xanthos’ room. He’s got a wakizashi on the wall, along with other monk decorations. Zuggtboi starts examining his things looking for research notes that could help us find him. Brigida looks VERY uncomfortable with that
    • We leave Xanthos’ room, move down the hall and eventually find Cassie in her office
    • Kaz tries to lie that she’s there to help identify the artifacts, but Gilbert Orenson comes upstairs and catches everyone (despite Zuggtboy’s excellent mimicry of Cassie’s voice)
    • Orenson demands explanations. Odo tries to calm everyone down. Kaz (who had cast Detect Thoughts), finally got desperate enough to demand the artifacts’ location in the hopes that he’d think of the location even as he refused to tell her
        ◦ he didn’t think of the location, but he did panic. “I don’t know why I would even tell you!” he shouts, paranoid and panicking about why anyone would be asking him about the artifacts
        ◦ Zuggtboy figures that general paranoia is a feature of Orenson’s personality
    • Kaz finally snaps “I’ve been very patient and offered to help you and you’ve rebuffed me at every turn. I’m DESPERATE!”
    • She doesn’t intend to intimidate, but she’s afraid enough that it’s intimidating, and he jumps. He looks terrified. Kaz is also surprised at her outburst, feels his confused fear, and her shoulders slump. “you don’t have any artifacts, do you?”
    • Orenson turns and storms out of the house, calling for Sir Gondrian. Odo grabs him and says firmly “Gilbert, stop. We need to talk”
    • Odo makes the point that Kaz and the others have a good heart, and random mercenaries wouldn’t help the town if all they wanted was to steal artifacts.
    • It’s at this point that Sir Gondrian shows up and Gilbert angrily explains what happened. Sir Gondrian backs us up, tells Gilbert to go back to his bullshit, and says he’ll speak with us
