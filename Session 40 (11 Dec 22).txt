    • Mari comes by and sketches the party in front of the fireplace, fully armored, for a couple hours
    • we go to meet Lady Renalia’s private summons, and are brought to her private solarium. We meet with her and her associate Urefius (who we met after the whole snafu on the spelljammer Moonbeam)
    • Lady Renalia asks us if we’re free for the next few weeks. She’s heard that the war against Lolth is climaxing, and that she’s almost destroyed, but it also means that the “vile demons” get back to what they should be doing, which is attacking devils. For that, we’ll need more weapons to replace the holy water globes we lost last time.
    • New plan: get the raw ingredients we need to manufacture the holy water globes. The main ingredient/limiting factor to producing them is a crystal called benignitite, a very rare mineral found deep in the mines of Arcadia
    • The Harmonium: former Sigil faction, dominant power in Arcadia (with the exception of gods/powers). They consider themselves in charge of things, and have banned benignitite exports (presumably to make their own weapons)
        ◦ It’s believed that the Harmonium kidnap chaotic creatures and place them into concentration camps to teach them to be more lawful
        ◦ Formian city called Altrik has plenty of benignitite. Formians are neutral, not allied with the Harmonium, so they’ll sell to us, but the Far Flung Fellowship has to help escort the goods
    • Formians hold a daily public auction to sell the benignitite, but they insist that each potential buyer give a speech about why they want to buy the crystals (and the Formians will sell to the selected buyer at the same price). Formians value peace and order, so any speech hat Urefius makes should take that into account. They’ve also just hit a large seam of particularly flawless crystals.
        ◦ OUR job is just to make sure that Urefius gets in and out safely every day.
        ◦ plenty of other people know about this large seam, but Urefius will be taking care of the competition
    • We follow Urefius to the portal to Altrik, which is on the edge of the Lady’s Ward and the Lower Ward (key is a metal ring). On the way, he tells us we’ll be meeting some associates there who will help us move the goods back to Sigil. The auction is held in a large hall at the center of the city.
        ◦ every time Kaz passes someone wearing a cloak with a detail she likes, she adds it to her own cloak. Her cloak is always purple though
        ◦ as far as Urefius knows, there’s no other portal out of Altrik (but there are definitely others in Arcadia)
    • The city is shaped like a wedding cake, with layer after layer of tall, castle-like architecture (though none of it is actually useful as defense in a siege – all of the “city walls” are just buildings). The streets are paved with cobblestones, and the buildings are all stone. The Formians are the main passersby, but there are a few gnomes, humans, and other races – it’s clearly a vibrant, trading city. The temperature is perfect.
        ◦ Kaz excitedly checks another box off of her “planes I’ve been to” list.
    • We reach the central building, which has a huge, cathedral-like ceiling. The hall is full of people from all sorts of planes. We’re given seats in the “buyer” area. One of the largest formians (a leader, called a murmark) welcomes everyone to the ‘auction’. 
    • There’s a glowing, winged humanoid near us (probably a celestial), seated next to several similar humanoids wearing amulets with a symbol on them that looks like the sun coming out from eclipse behind the moon. We see another group with two druid women led by a gold dragonborn, a group of several elongated blue creatures, and a group of earth elementals. There’s also a large contingent of humans and humanoids wearing metal armor and metal helmets. They look military, and they’re led by a beefy guy with a sash (probably Harmonium).
        ◦ We’ve seen a similar symbol on a haranger in Bytopia railing on about the “evils of laughter”. Kaz and Nevaeh recall that it’s the symbol of the Order of the Planes Militant, an order based in Mount Celestia and devoted to order, law, and goodness. They’re known for being uptight and constantly trying to prostelatyze
        ◦ Odo studies the Harmonium leader and determines that the leader has a higher constitution and equivalent AC to Odo himself. None of the other soldiers have more experience (class levels) or AC than Odo. He spends his whole speech ranting that it’s the duty of everyone else to follow the Harmonium’s laws and that 
    • Kaz looks around as the buyers start giving speeches, sees even more Harmonium guards placed around the room. Urefius takes his turn and gives a platitude-filled speech, but his cadence is good. It’s hard to tell what the Formians think of it, but we see the main leader starting to nod along. Urefius wins the largest share of crystals, and is uncharacteristically smiling and happy.
        ◦ “Whatever you did to me, it worked well” he says to Lana, who cast Enhance Ability on him before he went up and rolled a nat20 on his persuasion roll
    • Harmonium leader comes up and tells Urefius that he’d “better watch his back”. Urefius says something like “I’m sorry, am I getting in your way?” Everyone squares up, but the leader walks off with another parting “You better watch your back!”
        ◦ Kaz goes up to a nearby Formian guard and reports the incident, saying she’s “worried” about the Harmonium leader’s threatening and disorderly conduct, and that she and her friends are “just peaceful, law-abiding people”. The guard promises to report the incident to his superiors.
    • We hang around and wait for the delivery of our goods, receive our crates, and head back to the portal. We arrive to find a bunch of Harmonium guards (trying to stop us from leaving) facing off with a bunch of Formian soldiers (the actual authority who seem to be keeping the peace). With a bit of intimidation, the Harmonium disperse, the Formians disperse, and we head through the portal without a fight. To avoid linking the crystals to Lady Renalia, we bring the crates through to another portal in an old stable building (which changes its destination depending on the time of day). We arrive in a city in the Outlands and escort the goods in a covered wagon across the city to a warehouse, where it’s handed off to another group of armored humans (presumably) in Lady Renalia’s employ.
        ◦ their armor is reminiscent of the armored guards in Lady Renalia’s Treasury & Transfer
    • We arrange to meet Urefius at our home the following morning. We also learn that the Harmonium leader’s name is Major Braddius Dixon (goes by Brad). We return to our home and treat ourselves at a spa called “The Other Place” (run by Yarmid, a peaceful human who gives Upper Planar vibes).
        ◦ The spa is right across from the Great Gymnasium, which once housed the Transcendent Lead (a former faction in Sigil, now a guild). Their leader, a tiefling woman named Reece, was the only factal to survive because she had a premonition of the violence to come and dipped. She’s now guild leader and has a place on the Sigil advisory council.
            ▪ “factal” is the word for a faction leader, but it’s now extremely taboo to use the word
        ◦ We overhear gossip that the Doom Guard has returned, and hear how most of Sigil is worried about it.
    • We head home for the evening. Kaz casts Sending to her dad, tells him about her day and about Arcadia. He keeps forgetting that Sending has a word limit, but they’re happy to hear from each other nonetheless. She also tries to cast Sending to Zefirio, but doesn’t know him well enough for the magic to work.
    • We continue to accompany Urefius to Altrik for 25 days (though there’s not an auction every day).  Lana tries to grow more demon-poisoning mushrooms. Nevaeh gives services at the Selune chapel and earns a favor. Odo goes to work out at the Great Gymnasium since he’s self-consious about his figure and wants to be better than Brad. 
        ◦ Nevaeh also casts Divine Intervention every day until she succeeds, and asks Selune where Fredryk is (hoping that the more powerful magic will overcome whatever divination block surrounds him). She enters a supercharged divinatory trance, almost as if the paths of the past and future combine. She learns that Fredryk is hiding somewhere relatively nearby. She’s also sure that we’ll meet someone soon who will know where Fredryk is.
        ◦ Kaz asks Exilicor if they know the Elvish ruin where Drosys found the Conduit (they don’t). She then asks them to put her in the mythallar so that she can try to see something. She also can’t see through whatever magical darkness / mundane covering surrounds the mythallar, but she CAN just barely hear Asger speaking to someone else (even if she can’t make out the words). She listens every evening for weeks (and spends several nights sleeping off insanity), with Smutlana magically enhancing her perception. Asger isn’t always in the room when she’s listening, but she DOES occasionally make out a few words. He’s speaking Common, to someone with a higher-pitched voice who rarely speaks and seems like a lackey. Asger seems frustrated that he can’t quite figure out how to use the mythallar.
            ▪ Constantly casting Contact Other Plane is exhausting for Kaz
    • It’s now the 28th of Elaint. We’ve been hearing about a very large crystal that will go up for auction, but on the day of the auction Urefius doesn’t show up at our house. Jevrin brings a message from Lady Renalia that he’s been detained, and one of us will have to fill in for him at the auction. Kaz volunteers to give the speech, and drafts a quick speech in her journal on the way to the auction. The others bolster her charisma 
        ◦ Asked which buyer Kaz represents, she gives the same fictitious “Interplanar Trading Company” name that Urefius always gives
        ◦ Her angle is that she and her party have travelled among the planes, have championed peace and order throughout the multiverse, and are the best ones to continue to establish peace and order with the benignitite
            ▪ part of her speech: “You can see from our garb that we’re adventurers. We’ve seen many planes, and we’ve met many different people on our travels. We’ve fought with blades and magic when we’ve had to, but we’ve also negotiated peace and made friends and allies.”
    • Brad gets up and says “I rise today not to make a speech asking for a portion of the benignitite, but to take all of it. This benignitite has been banned from export by Arcadia. You can sell it all to us or not at all.” He walks out of the hall, followed by his entire contingent. The other buyers are shocked and outraged. The murmark leaders huddle and discuss, then return to the podium and announce “In the interest of peace, it has been decided that the auction will be suspended”
        ◦ One of the druid women comes up to congratulate Kaz and says she probably would have gotten the largest share for her speech. She introduces herself as Lucy, the gold dragonborn as Vertin, the other druid as Lua, and their small mustival advisor (small, mouse-like species) as Chiprick. They’re members of the Guardians, a fairly well-known group based in Elysium and devoted to goodness.
    • One of the celestial buyers in the crowd yells out that the Harmonium have gone too far, and need to be stopped by force. Kaz and Nev start egging him on and helping to rile the crowd toward stopping the Harmonium by force. Lucy stops them from speaking to the celestial directly, warning them that he’s the advisor to the Planes Militant.
    • Chiprick explains that his group has a plan. “We all have a right to the benignitite beneath this city, so I say we should just go and take some” He suggests we sneak down to where the benignitite is stored and get benignitite for ourselves.
    • Lana sneaks out and around to the loading dock, where we usually pick up the benignitite. She sees the Harmonium soldiers waiting on the dock, facing off against an angry crowd of buyers. One of the Planes Militant screams “they must be purified in holy fire!!” and shoots a fireball at the Harmonium. Both sides immediately start fighting, with Formians trying to intercede and stop the battle.
        ◦ Lana asks Kaz to get permission to buy any benignitite we can get from the Harmonium, but the Formians explain that they won’t even sell to the Harmonium.
    • Lana returns and explains the situation. Chiprick leads his group and ours to the crystals after both sides promise not to double-cross each other. We sneak into the center of the city, where there’s an entrance to the hive layer where the actual Formian city resides (and where the queen lives). We slip by several Formian guards, unnoticed, until we reach the end of a tunnel guarded by a large Formian. Chiprick flashes a signal and the Formian transforms back into a human mage (Agren Kolathka).
    • Agren, after confirming that Chiprick trusts the party, casts Fly on everyone except Lucy, Lua, and Vertin (who stay up to guard the tunnel entrance). We descend 200ft to the mine, he goes ahead to clear out the Formians, and directs us where to go. As we set out, Lucy calls out that the Harmonium are coming.
    • We reach an open chamber sparkling with perfect, glassy white crystals and immediately start mining. Nevaeh conjures the hut to block the entryway while Agren waits outside in murmark form to deter any murmark from entering. He tries to deter something else from coming in, but it says that it knows he’s lying and demands he stand aside. Kaz encourages him to run back behind the hut and protect himself, but just as he reaches her and Nevaeh the hut is dispelled. An 11-foot-tall planetar fills the tunnel, radiating unbelievable power as its sword lights with flame.
        ◦ Planetars are at a godlike level of power. They’re an almost mythic level of celestial. This one seems to be on the attack, and doesn’t listen to the party’s attempts to avoid a fight. Kaz assumes he’s here on behalf of the Harmonium

    • A Harmonium soldier also shows up with two of his buddies. Nev casts a full Heal on Odo, who’s taking the brunt of the planetar’s hits. Odo actually manages to trip the planetar and starts wailing on him. Kaz muddles the Harmonium soldiers with some Synaptic Static, in between rounds of doing some truly nasty damage to the planetar. Lana kills one of the Harmonium soldiers and immediately resurrects him as a Heather, fungus bursting from the skull.
        ◦ Kaz and Odo get the planetar down to 3hp before he heals himself. One more blast hitting him and I coulda done it.
    • Five more Harmonium run in. There’s now one for each of us. We keep fighting desperately until finally the planetar looks around, realizes that somehow we mortals are holding our own with intense magical power and weapons, and disappears. The Harmonium soldiers look incredibly disenheartened, and immediately surrender.
    • We go back to mining, until a horde of Formians appears. Both the Far Flung Fellowship and the Harmonium accuse each other of being the first to attack. The Formians take us to see Queen Unity.



Downtime Ideas:
check in on Kaz’s friends and family
Lana hasn’t been to Kaz’s home, but she got to the edge of the High Forest and we could potentially just travel the rest of the way. OR Kaz could take them herself when she gets access to Planeshift

You are all disarmed. Two Formian warriors flank each of you with a firm insectile claw on each of your shoulders. You see that Agren and Chipric have also been taken into custody, as have several surviving harmonium legionaries. You are led through the tunnels with large columns of formian warriors ahead and behind. 
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 12/16/2022 5:10 PM
Telepathically, Kaz reaches out to each party member in turn. “I can teleport myself and one other person back up the tunnel if this goes poorly. Who should it be?” Realizing what’s about to happen, she quickly adds “Don’t say it aloud! Just… I don’t know. Look over at who you want me to take”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 12/16/2022 6:18 PM
Nev looks at Odo
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 12/16/2022 6:34 PM
Kaz nods once.
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — Yesterday at 10:45 AM
Odo nods turns a little to the side while moving forward over his shoulder and sniffs the insectile claw
(what's that them claws of theirs smell like ?)

(disappointing 🤣 damn I was sure those exoskeleton insect claws would have a stench nvmmmm heheh 😂 )
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 11:06 AM
(I don't think they sweat)
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 1:28 PM
Kaz turns to one of the Formians. “Excuse me. When we meet the Queen, how should we address her? I’d hate to be impolite”
