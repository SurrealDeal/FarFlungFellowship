    • Kaz and Ganth stare into each others’ eyes for 5 mins to establish enough of a connection for Sending to work. She awkwardly asks him a few questions to pass the time, learns that he’s originally from a Prime world, but that he’s around 100 now (half-elven).
    • Torbold says that Lord Querial isn’t to be trusted, but Commandant Athelkara Ovidius may be trustworthy (he isn’t sure though, and warns us to be careful of who we trust)
    • People originally in the safehouse: Emmealot (werebear), Johar (mage), Asum (bronze dragonborn), Sten (burly blond human fighter from Isgard), Borvit (dwarf we followed from Sigil)
    • Second group who teleported in: Meili (muscular female barbarian) Torbold (halfling captain), Ganth (wizard), Boswell (half-elf ranger)
    • the scorpion people (tlincali) are slave-trading pirates
    • we return to Sigil through the portal and take a rest at the Red Lion tavern as usual. In the morning, Kaz goes down to the front desk and asks if a courier has come from Xosco’s auction house about the Tome of Clear Thought. The desk clerk says no one has come, but recognizes Kaz as a member of the Far Flung Fellowship and gives her a letter from another courier addressed to the whole group
        ◦ the signet on the letter is very rich, fancy, and complex, with a lot of mythical figures. The central figure is a dancing elf with very long hair with a moon hovering above. Odo asks Nevaeh if the signet is familiar from any past “waxxidents”. Nevaeh and Zug realize that the figure is Eilistraee (“ehless-tray-ee”, goddess of good drow, goddess of the moon and spiritual ally to Selune)
        ◦ “To the Far Flung Fellowship, I would be honored to have you call upon me at my residence (it gives a description of a place in the Lady’s Ward). Your reputation has preceded you.’ It’s signed Lady Renalia Efrione
            ▪ Kaz is wary, wondering how someone so wealthy could have heard of her relatively unheard-of party
    • Odo pays a nearby courier to check out the area around Lady Renalia’s home, saying ‘you don’t need to take no bait, I’m not trying to lure you in, I’m just trying to make sure things are going swimmingly’
    • Kaz finds some drunk people at the tavern, finds out that people have generally heard of her and that she’s a super rich noble, but can’t find out much more
    • we stop by the Selune temple on our way to Lady Renalia’s mansion, and Priestess Asara mentions that Lady Efrione is a great benefactor of the temple, and that Asara told Lady Efrione about Nevaeh. She mentions that Lady Efrione was very interested in the Moonstar family, and hopes it wasn’t out-of-line to bring up the party to her. Nevaeh gestures to her golden hair and the group’s purple cloaks, and remarks that it would be rather hard to hide anyway
        ◦ We can see the golden dome of her sprawling walled manor from the temple, even larger and more extravagant than anything noble-born Odo and Nevaeh have ever seen
        ◦ Nevaeh cleans up Odo before we’re greeted by Orwyn, a well dressed human butler. Odo spits in his hand, then holds it out in greeting. Kaz immediately uses Shape Water to remove the spit from a distance, nodding to Nevaeh as she does
        ◦ We were not told to take off our armor or weapons, unlike most rich-people places, though Nevaeh, Odo (with some prodding), and Zug do anyway for politeness (Nevaeh keeps her Armor of Gleaming on anyway, since it’s spotless. Zuggtboy takes off his hat for the first time in our company)
    • We’re led through a palatial, opulent manor to a posh sitting room. A drow woman wearing a fairly simple blue dress sits by the fire, across a 40ft room. We walk over to her, and she gives us a smile and a weak handshake.
        ◦ she’s clearly wealthy, but not ostentatious
        ◦ There’s a large Eilistraee sculpture in the room, and a small Selune sculpture beside it (Eilistraee was gone for about 100 years, and many of her followers turned to Selune during that time)
    • Lady Efrione reveals that she’s met some of Nevaeh’s family members back during the “Time of Trouble” when Selune and Shar had their avatars fight above Waterdeep. Selune’s avatar won.
        ◦ this was nearly 150 years ago
    • She mostly wants to catch up with the Moonstar, but is a bit curious about the rest of the party. She mentions that she’s originally from Toril as well, and asks if it’s everyone’s first time travelling the planes. Kaz says it’s not her first time, with a hint of pride, and confirms that she’s a planar expert when asked.
    • After Lady Efrione and the party have chatted for a while, a woman (who Lady Efrione doesn’t recognize) barges into our meeting claiming she has a message for her ears only. The Far-Flung Fellowship is immediately suspicious and blocks her entry, and when she can’t get around Odo, she attacks!
    • the assailant shoves Kaz aside from where she’s standing in front of Lady Renalia. The woman’s arm turns into yellow gelatinous ooze, and she stabs at Lady Renalia, who just manages to dodge the blow.
    • Nevaeh manifests her glowing golden wings to shield Lady Renalia as she runs to her panic room
    • Odo grapples the assailant, but she turns to mist and escapes his grasp, poisoning him. She then floats upward, transforms into a weird melted creature, and sprints off along the ceiling after Lady Renalia
    • Nevaeh turns back to interpose herself between Lady Renalia and the creature. Zug follows Lady Renalia, guarding her on the way to her panic room. She calls out to “Vorra” that they’re being attacked, and as they come into his bedroom he mistakes Zug for the attacker and throws a copper vase at him
        ◦ Vorra seems to be a human man with a deep voice and long dark hair. Lady Renalia explains that he’s her guest, and he’s allowed to come into the panic room with them both
    • Nevaeh blasts the creature apart with a series of Guiding Bolts, and its corpse sizzles as pieces hits the ground.
    • Kaz has heard of a demonic entity called a yochol, created by/serving the evil drow goddess Lolth. With its central eyeball, shapeshifting nature, and dissolving corpse, this creature looks like a yochol.
    • Several armed guards run in, looking hostile. Kaz and Nev manage to explain what happened, while Odo gets naked to “prep for a cavity search” as he waits to be arrested (he is not arrested)
    • After everything is straightened out, we’re all reunited. Lady Renalia is impressed by our quick reactions and strong fighting, and asks to speak further with us in private
