    • It’s the 11th of Eliasus
    • The tentacle creature has tentacles smooshed to Kaz’s forehead. Nevaeh wakes up to Kaz’s scream and shoots a Guiding Bolt at it. Kaz falls out of her hammock, crawls into a corner, and wildly hurls eldritch energy at the aberration, still screaming.
    • Odo and Lana run in and attack the aberration as well. Kaz blasts it again and it explodes, covering everyone in goo. Two crewmates run in, recognize the exploded creature as a Fear, and explain that they’re known pests in Wildspace that attach themselves to spelljamming vessels and cause nightmares (of things the victim is already worried about) to feed on the fear they create
    • Kaz figures out how to use Prestidigitation to clean herself, Nevaeh, and their hammocks (with only a few mistakes changing blotches of her shirt to different colors). The party rests for the evening, wakes as the ship docks at the asteroid Marvinia, and heads off with Captain Cloudsilver to report to Lady Renalia
        ◦ Kaz is familiar enough with the Captain to cast Sending to him
        ◦ On the way back, the Captain explains that the original plan had been to leave the weapon crates near the fortress and the tenari would pick them up without coming into contact with our crew. He thinks he saw that the fortress walls were splattered with something, indicating violence had taken place against Prazomal’s forces, but he only caught a glimpse.
    • We’re ushered into an oak-panneled room with frescoes and vaulted ceilings deep below Lady Renalia’s compound. Beside Lady Renalia is a creature with the head of a siberian husky and a fiendish-looking woman with folded wings (more fiendish than a tiefling, but not a full-on fiend).
    • Lady Renalia asks if we’ve brought the cargo back to Marvinia. Kaz and the Captain look surprised, since the plan was originally to leave the weaponry at the fortress.
        ◦ “Mezelle here came and told me that their forces at the fortress had been wiped out.” Lady Renalia says. She naturally assumed that we’d abort the mission.
    • Kaz explains what happened, and Lady Renalia immediately accuses the fiendish woman (Mezelle) of having arranged the attack, to which she indignantly replies “why would we do that?”
        ◦ Mezelle further explains that, while demons are known for double-crossing each other, she and her fellow tenari are under gesh spells to be loyal to & unable to disobey Prazomal (the recipient of the weapons)
    • Kaz tries to mediate and walk back through the scouting mission to find out how the secret weapons drop got leaked. She learns that Dog-head (Erathius) and Cpt Cloudsilver scouted the fortress via planeshifting.
    • Erathius explains that the only people who would’ve tried to stop us are either enemies of Prazomal (who Mezelle works for) or are those who want the blood war to end.
    • The symbol on the weapons crates was that of the Harmonium, a former Sigil faction now based in Arcadia.
    • Mezelle says that any demon lords might have decided to fuck over Prazomal, doesn’t provide specific names.
    • Odo whispers to Kaz, wondering if there are any ties between Lord Querial/the Vigilant Sentinels. Kaz asks the room if any of them have contact with Lord Querial & the Vigilant Sentinels. Lady Renalia confirms that she told him of the fortress’ location and asked him for what he knew about the lower planes.
        ◦ Kaz passes on that she’d heard that Lord Querial wasn’t to be trusted, but Lady Renalia refuses to believe that an angel could betray her to demons. 
        ◦ Erathius says that Lord Querial is a Deva. He can think of a few celestials who could find strange logic in betraying their cause, but Lord Querial isn’t one of them.
        ◦ Kaz definitely doesn’t believe either of them, mostly because she’s seen Branaris and he wasn’t acting right either
    • Kaz asks if Lady Renalia or Erathius know about the “fell prince and princess” from Nev’s vision. Erathius recognizes her words as being from the last prophecy of Hecorius, but isn’t convinced that the prophecy is linked to Nev’s vision. He says the demon sounds like it could be a maledeus (a mouthpiece of a demon lord). The other one could be an alufiend (daughter of a mortal and a fiend, like Mezelle)
        ◦ Erathius has wizard vibes, probably the one to cast Planeshift to scope out the fortress
    • We leave, taking our horses from Lady Renalia’s stable and taking them to a local stable. Kaz, Odo, and Lana sell their horses and agree to stable Nevaeh’s horse JoJo. Before he parts with Mud, Odo runs his finger along the nearly empty bottle of his Potion of Speed, feeds the residue to Mud, and whispers to him “cause havoc”
    • We do some shopping, buy some health potions. Nevaeh casts Commune while we’re out, asks if her family & Waterdeep will be safe from the war until the next full moon (yes), and asks Selune to please guide Tammy on her journey. She also tells Selune that we were attacked on the spelljammer but that “her friend Kaz” saved her. She thanks Selune for leading her to her friends, and asks if Lord Querial was directly involved in the ambush on us (no, that can’t be). Finally, she shyly tells Selune about “the amazing wildspace ship captain” we met, who she thinks is a fellow aasimar (and has a crush on). She asks if Cpt Cloudsilver would be interested in hearing from her again outside of work (yes!).
        ◦ revelations from the spell Commune are “screened” by the goddess’ other servants. Answers are based on what the deity’s servants know
    • Odo and Kaz go to the library. Odo looks up werebears, learns that it’s not as corrupting to the spirit as other forms of lycanthropy and werebears are usually good. Lycanthropy can be transferred by bite, but only if the creature wishes to transfer it.
        ◦ Odo knows already that Selune is a goddess of good lycanthropes, and that werebears can shift to their other form at will.
    • Kaz studies Oinos, the first layer of Hades. She learns it’s a miserable, disease-ridden wasteland populated by the shades of the evil dead. Mortals are subject to despair and apathy flooding into their minds while there, and if they give in they will become like the creatures that dwell there. It’s also populated by twisted hordlings, a form of fiend where “no two are alike” crawling across the wasteland. There are also eternal battles fought by the River Styx. The night hags herd larvae, the souls of extremely evil people that have been transformed into 4-5ft maggot-like creatures.
        ◦ Don’t deal with night hags, don’t trust them. They’ll keep their deals to the letter, but they’ll delight in tripping you up on the wording. 
        ◦ Pars Korvarik (settlement in the Gray Wastes where the hag Angina Lockjaw lives) is essentially a livestock town on the shores of the Styx. Think wild west town, but fucked up.
    • That evening, Kaz casts Contact Other Plane. Once again, she hovers before a glowing, crackling sphere of energy (Exilicor).
        ◦ Did Drosys find you accidentally? (unclear, presumably doesn’t know how Drosys found them)
        ◦ Did Drosys hurt you, deliberately? (maybe yes, maybe no. Seems stuck on the word “deliberately”)
        ◦ Are the problems caused by the Conduit getting worse? (no)
        ◦ Is anyone else looking for the conduit? (unclear)
        ◦ Are we even able to help ye? (maybe)
    • We consider trying to contact Drosys or Erfessa, but toss out the idea. They’re not powerful enough to count as “long-dead sages” for the spell. It’s likely that they’ve moved on to their deity’s home plane, and will soon merge with their deity’s consciousness if they haven’t already.
    • Nevaeh casts Sending to Captain Cloudsilver (and brings Kaz to her room for moral support), awkwardly surpassing the 25 word limit on her first casting and casting it again to finish her message. She asks if he’s still in Sigil, but he says he’s resturned to Marvinia to be with the ship. She asks him to meet up the next time he’s in Sigil and he says “Certainly. I’d like that very much.”
    • We rest for the night, then ask around for portals to Pars Korvarik. Lady Renalia doesn’t send her servants to Hades, so she doesn’t know of any portals to the plane. Lana suggests we go see Akon at the Friendly Fiend. Nev casts Augury and determines that asking Akon how to reach Pars Korvarik will result in Weal and Woe. Lana and Odo are excited and Kaz is hesitant, but we go anyway since “even if the talk with Akon is completely uncomplicated, we’re still going to Hades” – Kaz.
    • We talk to Akon. “I wouldn’t go there myself, not anymore at least, but… well, are you sure that you want to go there?” Lana: “We don’t want to, but we have to.” He says that the best place for us to go to find a portal to Hades is probably the Lower Ward (seedy industrial district) or the Hive (absolute dregs of society)
    • We find a night hag in the Lower Ward, who is willing to direct us to a portal and tell us the necessary key in exchange for locks of Kaz’s and Nev’s hair. Odo trades a vial of blood from a six-armed creature instead. She agrees to the trade and she’s so delighted she even gives us the portal key (a dried, wilted flower)
        ◦ the six-armed creature was an offshoot of the thing trapped in the endopotentiation chamber shaft in the Netherese mine complex
    • Smutlana notices a cloaked figure watching us as we follow the night hag, which quickly ducks away once spotted. The hag takes us to a manhole cover and pulls it back.
    • Before we hop into the portal, Lana brings up the cloaked figure. She and Kaz look around and just manage to catch a glimpse of a beaked figure ducking out of sight once more. We chase the figure, catch another glimpse of it fleeing around a corner, and Kaz Dimension Doors herself and Lana out in front of the figure. It’s a kenku, and they immediately flee from us back into Nev and Odo. Odo grapples them.
    • The Sons of Mercy catch the party handcuffing the kenku and demand that they release the kenku and everyone go their separate ways. We grudgingly do so. As Kaz turns away, she pries deep into the kenku’s mind and hears “That was Turdbeak! I have to report back!”
        ◦ Kaz is very suspicious about the timing between Lana telling Akon that she’d stolen her anti-scrying necklace from a rakshasa and the rakshasa’s servants finding her not even an hour later.
        ◦ Ranjat tended to send out his operatives wearing amulets of Proof Against Detection and Location
    • We jump through the portal and appear in a large arched gateway in a wall. Everything is shades of gray, and our purple attire stands out like a sore thumb. Two ten-foot tall guard skeletons ask our business, and Kaz explains that we’re there to see Angina Lockjaw. We’re allowed to enter Pars Korvarik.
    • We all immediately try to look less colorful, and it does manage to placate the gawking spirits. We’re surrounded by the unfriendly faces of human shades, fiends, and night hags. Wooden structures, tents, and maggot pens line the streets. The maggots are even worse than we’d read about, because their faces are the shriveled faces of the people they were in life. We can see a tower rising in the distance, its palisaded walls dark and imposing.
    • We can’t scry Angina Lockjaw, so we reluctantly turn to asking people on the street. Lana convinces another night hag to tell her Angina’s location in exchange for another of Odo’s vials of six-armed creature blood.
    • In the crystal ball, we see another night hag, riding on a black horse with a flaming mane and tail. Behind her is a huge herd of larvae. On her shoulder is a weird, shriveled-looking creature with pointy ears. “You’re in luck. She’s just a little ways that way. She must be coming in to sell her stock” We estimate that we could leave town and reach her by midday the next morning.
    • We head out of the city toward Angina. On the way, we pass by a small market with cries in various languages, selling larvae, monster parts, blood, and other horrible things. As we pass by the exit, we hear a fiend egging up a crowd staying things like “a time is coming, united, the Stygian realms shall conquer, the upper planes are weak ruled by the weaker, etc”
    • We walk for hours, past the occasional hoardling out in the waste. There’s nothing but despair, and it begins to weigh on the party. We rest for the night, but Odo can’t get a restful night’s sleep with the weight and is exhausted the following day.
    • We keep walking. We crest over a rise and come across a lone scarecrow. Wary, the party tries to keep their distance, but once we get within a hundred feet of it, it RUNS at us, stops, looks at us, and spins its head upside-down
    • As it looks at us, a purple night hag riding a Nightmare crests the hill opposite us. On her shoulders is a small winged creature. We can hear the larval centipede legs like rain as thousands of them follow her, whipped along by more scarecrows. Lana calls out to her and she rides up to us, her larvae surrounding us as well. She looks noticeably older than the other hags we’ve seen, with more wrinkles and scars.
    • Kaz explains that she’s from the Prime Material and she’s looking for the mirror that Angina once had. Angina grins. “Fascinating. Do you know the wizard?” 
      “Which wizard?” Kaz replies. “There’s a lot of them” The hag grins wider, the creature on her shoulder whispering in her ear. 
      “They don’t know” says Angina. She hops off the horse and pulls out a folding stool from her saddlebag, sitting down on it. She laughs to herself. “So you don’t have a wizard friend, looking for his slaves?” Lana mentions that the only wizard we know is Asger Mordelin, but he’s not really our friend. Angina grins even wider and agrees that he’s a rude bitch.
    • Angina: “And you didn’t come here following him?” 
      Kaz, tone sharpening: “Is he here?” 
      Angina: “Not right now, but he was here not three days ago” 
      Kaz: “What was he looking for? 
      Angina: “He was looking for a slave I acquired thousands of years ago, along with that mirror. He didn’t mention the mirror though, and you didn’t mention the slave.”
    • Kaz tries to offer up the six-armed creature’s blood in exchange for more information about the mirror, but the hag can tell Kaz really wants it. She explains that the mirror and the slave came from the same place, which is where Asger went. She can tell we’re fighters, and says that if we destroy her rival Lesha, the Skin Flayer, then she’ll tell us everything we want to know.
    • We agree to do the murder and walk for an hour in the direction she points us, and come upon Lesha’s yurt camp. There are plenty of larvae, surrounded by skeleton guards and small insectoid creatures. There’s a creature that looks like an elongated buffalo with elongated tusks. A night hag peeks out the yurt flap as we approach, stacks of leathery skins piled by her door.


Text RP
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/12/2022
Nev speaks up on the way to Lesha. “This is all getting pretty intense. Look at Odo, we've only been here for a day and look how much this place is weighing on him. He's physically exhausted from just existing here. We can't stay here much longer.”
“I'm afraid we're going to end up doing favor after favor to get what we need and we'll never get out of here. And I hate that I can't see anything in the sky except for gray. Look at that” she points into the air “There's nothing. Nothing but...depressive thoughts and feelings. We're not meant for this place. It's...wrong.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/12/2022
Kaz plods along, gaze fixed resolutely on the horizon in Lesha's direction. Her voice wavers slightly as she speaks, but doesn't break. "We'll make it. We'll kill this Lesha, find out what we need to know about Asger and the mirror, and then we'll be gone."
After a moment, she looks over at Nevaeh, gaze softening. "How are you holding up?"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/12/2022
“If I'm being honest…” she looks towards Odo then looks down “I'm not worried about myself...I'm worried about you guys.” She looks up with genuine concern “I mean I KNOW you guys are capable but this place, it's different.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/12/2022
Kaz nods. "It's the first truly evil plane we've visited. Everything I read about Hades assured me that this is normal though, and we're strong-willed enough to survive it. It'll pass once we're out"
She looks over at Odo as well, then murmurs softly to Nevaeh. "And, if he gets worse, we can always smash up that diamond of yours and fix him right up"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/12/2022
“Yeah...I guess that's true. I just... Odo's still finding himself,” she whispers “and that makes him vulnerable.” She looks back at her feet walking along the dirt “I'm probably just being silly. Selune will guide us all through this. We've done really well so far.” She manages a small smile
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/12/2022
Kaz bumps Nev gently with her shoulder. “‘S not silly. But we WILL get through it”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — 09/12/2022
Smutlana chimes in to brighten the mood. “Could be worse. I mean, someone called me handsome for the first time the other day. Sure, it was just a night hag who probably just wanted to torture me, maybe skin me alive, make an evil spell from my ground up bones. But it’s like… sometimes it just feels so good to be wanted, ya know? Even in the darkest of nights, the moon makes a silver lining if you know where and how to look.” 
“We gotta try to bring up each other’s spirits with inspiring nuggets of joy like what I just said. None of us are strong in the way Odo is, but we’re strong in other ways. We have to be strong for him now in ways that he can’t be strong for himself.”
“Now listen here - I know what would bring up the mood! Let’s talk about making money.”
Despite the infectious gray of the environs, Smutlana’s eyes glimmer for a moment with excitement as if by their own light.
“Now Nev - I know you’ve grown in power recently and are needing more materials for you moon magic. And quite frankly, I’m in the same boat, except it’s made out of mushrooms obviously and not moon magic. The boat that is.”
Noticing the quizzical stares, Smutlana groans and sighs emphatically. “… Ok forget the fucking metaphor! How the hell can we squeeze some gold outta this goddamn night hag so we can buy me and Nev more shiny things? The dead one will have loot on her for sure. But Angina… she’s on our side, at least with respect to Asger. Can we use that to our advantage? Odo, do you have any more blood or ichor or otherwise weird shit? What about that goo from the dream monster?” 
For comfort, Smutlana draws out the seashell and starts affectionately cooing as if it were a baby. Because it’s a shiny. 
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — 09/12/2022
Kaz tilts her head to the side, thinking. "Hags often collect valuable items, I believe. Certainly Angina had the mirror. Lesha might have a few treasures as well"
Nevaeh (Alicia) — 09/12/2022
“Yeah, I mean, I know I do owe some coins for the coin purse. What with this armor and my new hammer.” She twirls it in her hands. “Finding ways to make money that don't involve killing people and taking their stuff would be a nice change of pace though”
Odo Falcanspur (Mike) — 09/13/2022
Odo looks out towards where Lesha’s encampment is. "mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
Hearing Smutlana he pauses, rummages around in his bag, and digs out 9 Gnothic Candles & the single jug of salt cured abyssal chicken (though not much remains inside).
Odo walks slowly crouching as to hopefully not be spotted from such distance from the line of sight to the Hag’s encampment and makes his way over to Smutlana. His mind seems to be elsewhere
"Reckon this all I done got, might or might be useful I reckon I ain't too sure - Kaz done have that last remaining vial - I reckon didn't collect none of that goo from that there fear on the vessel"
Odo hands Smutlana the items, nods briefly
Odo then goes back to take lead point surveying the horizon
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 1:34 PM
“Thing here is - on second thought, we need to protect Nevaeh even more than Odo. She is our light in this darkness, our breadcrumbs back home to the goodness in our souls. We cannot allow her to be corrupted or we could get lost in the depravity and have no way back. Just being down here is risky enough. Nevaeh must not interact directly with the vile beings here, the rest of us should step in like what Kaz did with Angina.”
“Nevaeh, do you concur?”
Nevaeh (Alicia) — Yesterday at 1:44 PM
“I can offer a lot of protection here. In some ways it's what I've trained my whole life for. I'm just not confident in myself enough yet that I can protect all of you from this too.”
Smutlana "Lana" Smutwhisper — Yesterday at 2:36 PM
“In battle it can’t be helped, that’s different. I mean with interacting and negotiating with these foul denizens such as night hags and such.”
Kasma "Kaz" Planewalker — Yesterday at 2:39 PM
Kaz looks Nev over, noting the bags under her eyes. “I don’t think Nev’s that fragile, Lana. But aye, this mirror is my quest, so I can do the talkin’”
