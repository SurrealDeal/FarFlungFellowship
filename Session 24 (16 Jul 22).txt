    • That evening, the party gathers in main room. Everyone sits in a circle. Kaz’s journal sits before her in the circle’s center, open to the freshly copied Contact Other Plane spell. Kaz begins chanting in Deep Speech, which sounds like a lot of layered whispers without distinct words
    • She feels her mind drawn out of her skull and into space. It’s a very strange experience, a bit like casting Dissonant Whispers on herself, but Kaz manages to keep her focus as her mind is pulled through the black hole tunnel. She finds her consciousness in a different place, a black void with shimering shapes like stars. She asks her five questions.
        ◦ Why save me?: One of the points of light grows brighter, approaching Kaz until it looks like the sun. The light is blinding, but she can still see. The response coalesces as a thought in her mind: “what?”
            ▪ Kaz gets the sense that Exilicor wasn’t the one to ensure she survived her encounter with the Conduit, perhaps because they couldn’t or because they didn’t know she existed at the time.
        ◦ What do you want in exchange for the power you've given me?: Kaz feels her mind being examined by something, her thoughts pulled to the surface. For a moment, her mind goes blank, then the response coalesces. “what?”
            ▪ Exilicor probably isn’t even aware that Kaz is drawing power from them. Not unusual for Great Old One pacts
        ◦ Do you know what’s going on in the planes?: Kaz feels Exilicor examine her mind further, sights and memories from her travels flashing before her eyes. “Unclear”
            ▪ maybe they can see what’s going on (through her or otherwise) but don’t understand it
        ◦ Did you make the Conduit?: A very clear, quick “No”
        ◦ Who did?: “Unclear”
    • UNO REVERSE CARD
        ◦ Kaz sees an image of the Conduit as a thought forms. “BAD”
        ◦ She sees an image of the mythallar with the ten-pointed star, then an image of mythallar forming, then the sense that she’s being asked a question. She responds with “No, I don’t make mythallar.”
        ◦ Kaz sees an image of herself and an image of Drosys. Again, she feels like she’s being asked a question. She responds “Aye, we have the same powers.”
        ◦ She sees an image of the mythallar again, and again the thought crystallizes: “BAD”
        ◦ As the spell fades, Kaz feels another thought trying to form. For a moment, she can’t quite think it, almost as if it’s a word on the tip of her tongue. Finally, a single thought coalesces. “HELP”
    • yeeted back to reality
    • never an instance where Kaz made contact with a creature and bargained for power, just woke up like that
    • ‘endopotentiation process’ was dangerous, not specifically the mirror, mythallar was being used to create stable interplanar portals in a way that we gather was unique
    • Kaz’s crytal necklace was made of a crystal that formed on her head when she woke up. Drosys’ staff was made of layered versions of the same crystal
        ◦ could not manifest the crystal in Limbo
        ◦ Githzerai prior smelled the crytals and was reminded of aberrant mindflayers, but were hesitant to explain further. Lana found out from the chief gardener that bits of the crystal can be found when the mindflayers go back and forth between the planes and the place where they come from. The amount that Kaz had was a HUGE quantity, which is why they assumed it must have been of mindflayer origin.
    • we discuss plans, decide to find out more about mindflayers (to hopefully find out more about the crystals) 
    • Kaz tries to cast Contact Other Plane to reach Branaris, but the spell doesn’t take and she can’t contact him. Instead, she finds herself in contact with something else.
        ◦ Who is this?: “Someone very powerful”
        ◦ what do you want?: “what do you want?”
        ◦ Where is Branaris?: “who?” (insight: can’t really tell if it’s a lie)
        ◦ “I can give you power if that’s what you want. DO you want power?” (Kaz tries to cut the connection, but can’t)
        ◦ Are you a devil or a demon?: “Those are very rude words”
        ◦ How did you interrupt this spell?: “You contacted me.”
        ◦ Kaz gets the sense that when Contact Other Plane couldn’t reach the intended recipient, it instead reached out to find “a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious entity from another plane.”
    • We confer, realize that we can try to find Fredryk and get info from him. Nev contacts Selune with Commune. Dark clouds form around her, and her eyes glow.
    • Nev asks three questions.
        ◦ Is Fredryk in the Inner Planes?: Unclear, accompanied by an image of a moon clouded over
            ▪ we get the sense Selune can’t see Fredryk either
        ◦ Is Fredryk controlling Branaris?: full moon turns to a new moon, light going out. Nev gets the sense that the message is “that couldn’t possibly happen”
            ▪ Selune was comfortable saying that the idea of one of them controlling the other was crazy, but since she couldn’t actually see them, she couldn’t give a straightforward “no”
        ◦ Does my father want me to find him?: Nev sees a full moon, but with clouds in the sky. She senses that she’s being given a somewhat unclear answer because of a lack of clarity in general (Branaris’ location & disposition are hidden to Selune), but Selune’s best guess is that her father wants to see her
    • after sleeping on it for a bit, Nev gets the sense she could discern something more, perhaps with a spell that allowed Selune to answer with something other than a yes or no.
    • We decide to go to Yeoman, in the Twin Paradises of Bytopia, to find out more about the Conduit. There’s a doorway in the Lady’s Ward that opens to Yeoman if the traveler has a fresh apple
        ◦ We buy five apples from Elysium, one for each of us to eat and one to use as a key. We see a couple gnomes travel through ahead of us.
    • We find ourselves on a nicely cobbled street in what looks like a quaint German village. We look up and see a rugged sylvan landscape overhead instead of sky, stretching to the horizon. Enormous rock pillars connect our land to the land above. Plenty of well-dressed gnomes go about their business around us.
    • Nev casts Tongues on Kaz, and Kaz grants her the ability to Comprehend Languages with the Rod of Understanding. Kaz gets directions to the Exterra Trading company. She asks about the mirror’s history, learns that Spen Aolani was the trader who acquired the mirror and that he’s currently manning the company stall at the Festival of Wonders.
        ◦ Most of the artifacts on display are from the inner planes
        ◦ Kaz also asks if they’ve ever seen anything like her amulet, but they haven’t.
    • We head to the Festival of Wonders. Hundreds of white tents filled with tons and tons of clockwork contraptions line the streets. Wind-up toys, giant automatons, etc. There are also carnival games and food. It’s a very festive atmosphere.
    • People are getting rides on a giant clockwork thunder lizard of the chultan peninsula (dinosaur). There’s a face-painting automaton, and a chess-playing automaton. There’s a game with a complex array of gears, and you win if you correctly guess which way a gear will turn. There’s a colorful hot air balloon (not that any of us have ever seen one before). Kaz buys everyone 30 tokens to go wild.
        ◦ Kaz and Nev get matching stars on their cheeks from the face-painting automaton, Kaz and Odo ride the lizard around town. Lana sees a mechanical gerbil that sniffs around a bunch of potted plants. She and Kaz walk over and learn that it’s a “super sniffer,” which can find anything it recognizes the smell of, and that they can sell us an earlier version of the prototype on display for 5,000gp. He also says that living truffle pigs can find mushrooms, but there really aren’t any at the automaton show.
    • We find the Exterra Trading Company stall. It’s mostly oddities and curiosities, mainly from the elemental planes. One is a pot with an extremely bright flame inside, seemingly alive. They also have clockwork ballerinas, glowing on the inside from heat, dancing on a table in the center. They’re sold for 1,000 gp.
    • Spen is a red-skinned man with flaming hair. He seems to be part human and part Efreeti (a genasi). Kaz shows him an illusion of the mirror, and he remembers it. He doesn’t know it’s history, but he got the mirror at a sale of confiscated goods at the office of the Quartermaster of the Illuminated Prefecture in the Pyraculum district in the City of Brass.
        ◦ City of Brass is the capital city of the Efreeti empire, in the elemental plane of Fire. It’s ruled over by the Grand Sultan of the Efreet, and is an even larger planar nexus than Sigil (though less well connected to the planes). It’s not a nice, welcoming place. Police are called the Illuminated. The stuff being sold was confiscated from various people arrested by the police.
        ◦ Lana knows that Efreet are generally supercilious and vain, and consider themselves to be the paragons of genies. Appealing to their vanity might help get what we want.
    • Spen offers to be our guide (for a fee) and we accept. We arrange to meet him at the Sigil gate to the City of Brass
        ◦ Kaz asks if the Quartermaster would be willing to answer questions about the mirror. Spen suggests we might want to bring a lot of money to “lubricate the transaction”
        ◦ Kaz recalls that genies live on the four elemental planes: Efreet (Fire), Marid (water), Dao (earth), Djin (Air). All genies are generally antagonistic to each other. The Efreet occasionally cooperate with the Dao and are at war with the Djin.
    • On our way back to the city, we pass an open square and see an opulently dressed man haranguing the townsfolk. He’s putting on an air of authority. “Therefore my friends, order and obedience to a single authority is the best way to live. We must comport ourselves with dignity and avoid the ridiculous and disruptive noise that others call ‘laughter’”
        ◦ Embroidered clothes, medallion on his chest which looks like a sun emerging from behind a moon. The sun has a face on it, shining forth as if coming out of eclipse. Kaz isn’t super familiar with whatever it is, but knows she’s seen it before in Sigil.
        ◦ Kaz reads his surface-level thoughts, detects the fervor behind his words and passionate devotion to his cause
        ◦ Odo can tell this guy has more class levels total than we do, and that he has more HP than Odo himself (more than 77)
